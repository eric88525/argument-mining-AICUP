Likewise , for two decades , developmental evolutionists have been emphasizing the importance of developmental `` constraints `` that influence course of evolution via their effects on the generation of variation .

Pouring bleach down a toilet is killing : it kills bacteria . Slaughtering a cow for meat is killing . Murder is an illegal killing of a human . For an abortion to be murder , a country must define the embryo and/ or fetus as a human and must make the killing of that embryo and/ or fetus illegal . As to the idea that we are all glad we were not aborted , this is a nonsense statement . It 's like being glad that my house did n't blow up last night killing me in my sleep before I knew what had happened . On that note , I 'm really glad I did n't suffer a heart attack whilst typing this reply ! We are taking thousands of lives . It 's whether the killing is justified that is important . That is what the whole abortion debate comes down to : does a woman have the right to chose to kill a fetus that is growing within her .""","""You seem fairly intelligent .

546,"""O.k. , lets go through your scenario . The government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed . Somehow all Americas nuclear arms were obliterated . The invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms . Now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up . The five rounds with 200 million guns , works . The population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers , though the price is high in terms of casualties . America is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place . The year is 2004 , the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food . But each of the 400 million people has a gun , with lets say 30 rounds each . The population now has 12 billion rounds , and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities , and lets also assume for the hell of it , that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope ( just for fun ) . Same situation , same invading force . The population rises up , taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches . Lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles , 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun , lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere , and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know . To overthrough the standing American army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes , tanks and naval units . First off , 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people , so you have a lot of venerable areas . Where ever the militia units try to form , they are killed by tanks , even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through America who has the greatest tanks in the world , you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the American armed divisions . But , wait . Lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population . Lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units , lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks , and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect . To defeat the American army of planes you would , again , have to have massive numbers ( or technology superior planes ) . So the population tries shooting down the planes , but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles . But again , wait . Somehow , without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force , all planes are spotted ( miles away ) and shoot down by the UNTRAINED militia . The genius military leaders ( who no body though to kill ) work no doubt . Yet still , the population is defeated because if I remember correctly , the militia doesnÂ ’ t have naval units . So even if all the inland forces could be killed , the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force ( which is very large because it had to defeat the American navy , the greatest in the world technologically ) . But lets assume , the population just swims to the invading ships , kills the crews , and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships . Thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the American resistance . I am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then AmericaÂ ’ s armies for one simple reason . The only way you could defeat the American ICBMs is to have a blitzkrieg ( I know my spelling sucks ) like attack . Most of the ICBM silos are n't connected to the internet , mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack , so any rebuttal involving the virus-like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone . Now , you may be wondering what am I trying to say here . Well its simple , if somehow , just somehow , the entire military force of the U.S. was obliterated , it would take just one ICBM hit on the enemy 's capital city to make attack impossible . Again , the blitzkrieg like attack ? Even if that worked the U.S. , like Russia and a few other nuclear powers , keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over , and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army . So it would never happen that the U.S. would be left nuclear-naked . But lets assume that happened ( maybe during a really , REALLY cool party some XXXXX colonel peed on them , and they just fried ) . The genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air , ground and sea . You still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the U.S. probably spend several trillion doing it ( I know , thatÂ ’ s a pretty low number for the invasion of America ) , and in that case most likely have satellites and long-range missiles ( again lets assume somehow AmericaÂ ’ s own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all AmericaÂ ’ s nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event ) . The hugest , most glaring problem with the militia , unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop , they would have to gather . And if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in , to order to defeat the large invading army , they would be taken out very easily by 1 . ICBMs launched from enemy subs 2 . Prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence ( remember those satellites ) 3. all groups preparing for `` battle `` so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars , ambushes , rockets , infantry rushes , tank columns etc . before they knew what hit them . 4 .

546,"""O.k. , lets go through your scenario . The government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed . Somehow all Americas nuclear arms were obliterated . The invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms . Now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up . The five rounds with 200 million guns , works . The population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers , though the price is high in terms of casualties . America is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place . The year is 2004 , the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food . But each of the 400 million people has a gun , with lets say 30 rounds each . The population now has 12 billion rounds , and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities , and lets also assume for the hell of it , that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope ( just for fun ) . Same situation , same invading force . The population rises up , taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches . Lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles , 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun , lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere , and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know . To overthrough the standing American army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes , tanks and naval units . First off , 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people , so you have a lot of venerable areas . Where ever the militia units try to form , they are killed by tanks , even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through America who has the greatest tanks in the world , you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the American armed divisions . But , wait . Lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population . Lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units , lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks , and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect . To defeat the American army of planes you would , again , have to have massive numbers ( or technology superior planes ) . So the population tries shooting down the planes , but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles . But again , wait . Somehow , without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force , all planes are spotted ( miles away ) and shoot down by the UNTRAINED militia . The genius military leaders ( who no body though to kill ) work no doubt . Yet still , the population is defeated because if I remember correctly , the militia doesnÂ ’ t have naval units . So even if all the inland forces could be killed , the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force ( which is very large because it had to defeat the American navy , the greatest in the world technologically ) . But lets assume , the population just swims to the invading ships , kills the crews , and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships . Thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the American resistance . I am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then AmericaÂ ’ s armies for one simple reason . The only way you could defeat the American ICBMs is to have a blitzkrieg ( I know my spelling sucks ) like attack . Most of the ICBM silos are n't connected to the internet , mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack , so any rebuttal involving the virus-like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone . Now , you may be wondering what am I trying to say here . Well its simple , if somehow , just somehow , the entire military force of the U.S. was obliterated , it would take just one ICBM hit on the enemy 's capital city to make attack impossible . Again , the blitzkrieg like attack ? Even if that worked the U.S. , like Russia and a few other nuclear powers , keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over , and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army . So it would never happen that the U.S. would be left nuclear-naked . But lets assume that happened ( maybe during a really , REALLY cool party some XXXXX colonel peed on them , and they just fried ) . The genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air , ground and sea . You still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the U.S. probably spend several trillion doing it ( I know , thatÂ ’ s a pretty low number for the invasion of America ) , and in that case most likely have satellites and long-range missiles ( again lets assume somehow AmericaÂ ’ s own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all AmericaÂ ’ s nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event ) . The hugest , most glaring problem with the militia , unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop , they would have to gather . And if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in , to order to defeat the large invading army , they would be taken out very easily by 1 . ICBMs launched from enemy subs 2 . Prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence ( remember those satellites ) 3. all groups preparing for `` battle `` so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars , ambushes , rockets , infantry rushes , tank columns etc . before they knew what hit them . 4 .

Here are just some of the facts that are seldom taught in AmericaÂ ’ s public school classrooms : The most frequently recognized source for political inspiration for the founding fathers was the Bible , which was referenced in some 34 % of the founding fatherÂ ’ s quotations . The first reference to God as the foundation of an American colony was noted in the Â ‘ Mayflower Compact , Â ’ dated November 11 , 1620 : Â “ Â….Having undertaken for the Glory of God , and advancement of the Christian faith , and the honour of our king and country , a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia ; Do by these presents , solemnly and mutually in the presence of God and one another , covenant and combine ourselves together into a Civil BodyÂ….Â ” Many of the founding fathers recognized that the principles of civil law were inseparably linked to Biblical truths . James Wilson , one of the original Supreme Court Justices , and a signer of the Constitution , explained , Â “ Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divineÂ…Far from being rivals or enemies , religion and law are twin sisters , friends , and mutual assistantsÂ…Â ” Additionally , the United States Supreme Court specifically recognized America as a Christian nation .

1030,"""Much debate has been given to the second amendment , but what do these four words inparticular really mean . They are saying that individuals have the right to `` own `` arms , and that individuals also have the right to `` bear `` arms . But what does bear mean , it means that you have the right to keep a firearm on or about your person at any time you so choose to . Furthermore , I have found nowhere in the constitution where we are limited to `` certain types `` of firearms . I currently am awaiting the arrival of my ccl , but is it truly constitutionaly legal for me to even have to have a licsense to carry my handgun , concealed or open either one . Does the constitution state when and where you can carry a handgun , or a long gun as well .

1166,"""In anthropology and biology , the term Evolutionism is nowadays used specifically for historical theories or beliefs of early sociocultural evolutionism developed in the 18th and 19th century that organisms are intrinsically bound to improve themselves through progressive changes that are heritable .

Article 1 Thus , to begin , in the first article it was determined by the researchers that : No better codes out of a million biosynthetically restricted codes . This conclusion might be misleading though ( addressed here ) , as the paper states that the tested codes were from a biosynthetically restricted set based on the current hypothesis of the evolution of the genetic code from pre-biotic scenarios . When not viewed from this point of view , other , more optimized codes are possible . The next article ( nr 2 ) shows that : Thus showing in that analysis which include all possible codes ( not only biosynthetically restricted codes ) that the genetic code is partially optimal with regards to error minimization . It should be noted though that analysis only included a subset of the possible optimality feature of the code . From article 3 The analysis above did not include other nearly optimal features of the genetic code including : A ) The actual code is far better than other possible codes in minimizing the number of amino acids incorporated until translation is interrupted after a frameshift error occurred . B ) The code is highly optimal for encoding arbitrary additional information , i.e. , information other than the amino acid sequence in protein-coding sequences . Thus , two more features for which the code is close to being optimal . What is interesting about these two optimal features is that they may facilitate evolution i.e . the code is primed for the future by being optimal in allowing future incorporation of additional information . In article nr.4 The coevolution theory of the origin of the genetic code is discussed . The theory suggests that the genetic code is an imprint of the biosynthetic ( biosynthetically restricted ) relationships between amino acids . A few interesting observations can be made : Firstly , from the article : It should be noted that other exotic amino acids are also used by a few other codes ( derived form the original ) . E.g . Selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are encoded for in many archaea and vertebrates . Archaea , however seem to be the most primitive organisms , thus these encoded amino acids must have been fixated early on . Thus an interesting question can be applied to an `` evolving `` code as posited in the above quote : Are these `` still evolving `` mRNAs , still evolving ? Or did it hit an inevitable global optimum ? Secondly , from the article : Is it correct to assume that in the presence of the precursors of the standard genetic code ( e.g . intermediates of glucose degradation and the citric acid cycle ) , the intimate relationship between these molecules resulted in the inevitable organization of the genetic code ( global optimum of the system ) ? Articles 5-7 These articles discuss fascinating mathematical representation of the genetic code . For example , in article 6 a representation of the genetic code as a six & # 8211 ; dimensional Boolean hypercube is proposed . Abstract : Article 8 : In this article it once again discusses the optimality of the code and a few fascinating conclusions were made . For example : Also form the article : Thus , an important point is raised : The article cautions on blithely using natural selection as an explanation for the features of the genetic code . Article 9 : In this article , the functional integrity and how the architecture of the code relates to it is discussed . From the article : Thus , the properties of the code allow it to maintain its own functional integrity . Also form the article : The maintenance of the integrity of the code is not dependent on selection , but dependent on internal variables ( feedback system ) for maintaining functional integrity . Again , showing another form of optimality . In article 10 : Fascinating research was conducted whereby a sundry of different unnatural amino acids with novel three and four base codons have been selectively incorporated ( engineered ) into proteins yielding viable organisms . An intriguing question arises from this research . It is easy to imagine these to arise through chance and selection ( e.g . amino acids with photoaffinity ) and then be incorporated into the standard code . Yet the code seems to remain stagnant . For billions of year after fixation , little evolution happened in the code . Why ? Did it arrive at a global optimum in a pre-existing fitness landscape , with a pre-existing fitness function ? Finally , Article 11 : The article cites many of the optimal properties above and concludes : Indeed . The genetic code sure is interesting . Whatever the explanation for the origins of the code , whether intentional agency , only RV+NS , self-organization or a combination of these , the fact that these processes converged on a single , reasonably optimal code that is able to facilitate evolution makes it look like it was an inevitable result from the system . The system seems to be rigged and biased towards certain outcomes similar to the evolution of life .""","""Again , as an ignorant layman , I can only get the gist of this material , but how anyone could possibly argue against the genetic code as a product of intelligent design is beyond me .""",DISAGREE,"""The purpose of this thread is to discuss recent findings on the optimality of the genetic code .

Duo_Maxwell 's point is when creationists are incapable of refuting a fact that disproves their worldview , they switch to non scientific tactics that have nothing to do with the veracity of the scientific theory in an attempt to confuse the issue .

Sure you do , probably due to ignorance , but none the less ...... You said in another thread `` My point exactly . Carbon dating is by no means accurate , there it does not refute creationism. `` Carbon dating and radiometric dating are very accurate . But like any tool , when used improperly , they wo n't give accurate results . But when used properly , they give excellent data . How do we know they are accurate , because they are cross checked , they are verified by other dating methods . Samples that are dated by radiometric dating methods are dated by more than one method before a date is reached . For a sample to be dated by 2 different isotopes and both isotopes are flawed yet give the same date range is simply impossible . Carbon dating ( which is only good for about 50,000 years ) is checked against ice core samples , dendochronology , lake varves , just to name a few other dating methods , and it is virtually always verified . For all these different dating methods to be wrong and still give us the same dates just ca n't happen . 4 ) Refuse to acknowledge anything they simply do n't like 4 . ) Because we do n't give the response you would like is not wrong . No , creationists ignore the data that refutes their points . 5 ) When faced with a point they can not use # 2 on , ignore it completely like it does not exist 5 . ) Do n't think so Then you 've done no research on the subject and have n't read many of the creatinist posts on forums like this one .

3527,"""A small p-value by itself isnÂ ’ t enough to preclude chance .""","""Oh my , but is n't you 're whole endeavor to say that life has a small p-value , therefore could not have possible arisen by chance . I just happen to dispute the low p-value of life arising . Not only do evolutionists usually not accept a low p-value for life forming , we Pastafarians also do not accept it , since we know that there is 100 % chance of the FSM creating life with His Noodly Appendage . Then he starts equating the Bible Code ( which has been debunked , I mean seriously debunked , start here ) . In my mind , if the Isaac Newton of Information Theory says , `` At the same time that research in the Bible Code has taken off , research in a seemingly unrelated field has taken off as well , namely , biological design . These two fields are in fact closely related ... The relevant statistical methodology is identical for both fields , `` and I say that if one of those methodologies has been debunked , then so has the other . I think William Demski and other founding fathers of ID creationism are the movement 's worst enemies . They contradict themselves repeatedly and usually their words can easily be used against them to refute or debunk ID itself , and I do n't mean by quote mining or any other creationist tactic . On one hand there is Michael Behe , who under oath claimed that in order for ID to fit a definition of science , that definition also had to be broad enough to include astrology , and on the other hand there is William Demski , who claims that ID and the Bible Code follow the same statistical methodology and are very closely related . To me , it looks like these guys should be telling fortunes , not lobbying school boards . Well , I do suppose they are mostly sticking to selling books and lecturing for $ 200 an hour , so you 've got to give them credit for keeping up the sham for so long .

Like that bitch that kills off the weak pup in her liter , we kill of tens off thousands of weaker people in the quest for dominance . When was the last time you saw a german shorthair launch cruise missles to wipe out thousands of weaker pups for the advancement of some meaningless idealogical nonsense ? Next time you are sitting on your XXX in your favorite easy chair marveling at the `` accomplishments `` that have `` bettered `` the human race , while your bretheren are off killing people in order to further your idiotic ideological BS , you might keep in mind that the greatest difference between humans and animals seems to be that , while animals generally do their own killing , truly `` refined `` humans such as yourself ( and most other `` civilized `` people ) , get to set and home and send others out to do their dirty work . True , we have invented all kinds of mralistic , idealistic mumbojumbo to convince ourselves that we are more than just squabbling apes , but at the end of the day , that is all we are . Unfortunatly , we have managed to `` refine `` our instincts to the point that they are no longer sensible or natural . We still feel the instinct to kill , and we do so more effectivley than any other species on the planet . Unlike other species , which generally kill out of need , we have no need to kill , so we invent reasons in order to satisfy our blood lust .""",AGREE,"""Man has changed significantly in the past few thousand years .

4081,"""Indeed . Many people do n't realize that the commandment is not `` thou shalt not kill , `` but `` thou shalt not murder. `` The important question then becomes , when is killing murder ? I have no doubt that God cares for the lives of fetuses . But I also have no doubt that God cares for the lives of pregnant women . The reason I brought up the Exodus passage is that it 's often taken to establish that abortion is murder , and that performing an abortion should be punished accordingly . But the passage is n't talking about abortion at all . Which just leaves us with the question of when it is or is n't acceptable to take a life , and the passage does n't provide guidance to that general question , either .""","""How is that conclusion derived at ?

Your intent might be misinterpreted by some who have not read `` Origin `` and are unfamiliar with Darwin thoughts . To the uninformed , your claim about what Darwin said could easily be misinterpreted to mean that even accidental changes to the environment by man that cause evolutionary change in populations is `` artificial selection. `` Of course , you could n't have meant that , since that is clearly not what Darwin was talking about . The context of the quote that you cite makes that clear . The whole context of the quote is in the chapter on Variation Under Domestication . Darwin does not discuss accidental changes to the environment in that chapter .

5047,"""Have you ever explored micro-biology . It is the most amazing universe you 'd ever want to explore . It makes the macro-biology world look like lego blocks . If you 've ever looked up at the stars and stood in amazement , that 's childs play . Just a bunch of macro-scopic hyper-symmetric globules of matter interacting according to almost perfect text-book formulas . In the micro-biology world , we have almost no understanding of the complexities of interaction .. We have ZERO formulas that can predict appropriate interaction ( though we spend hundreds of billions of dollars trying 'guesswork ' in medical labs ) . micro-biology is the computer-programming world of individual atoms . The number of combinations of atomic interaction is mind-numbing - yet micro-biology has obviously harnessed certain useful patterns . Discovering DNA was like discovering that we can store programming code on electrical tape . That 's a great discovery , but that is a far cry from learning to create software artificial intelligence ( another area we 're probably 100 years away from ) . Defining 'life begins at conception ' is like saying that an airplane becomes an airplane when then contract is signed for a work-order . It 's a meaningless point in time relative to the MILLIONS of complex interactions that are necessary for an airplanes life-cycle . Conception is the formation of a zygote , two gametes that are wonderfully complex machines that come in contact in a VERY small subset of life forms ( most life-forms do not use sex-discrimination as a method of reproduction ) . If you looked at primitive single-celled micro-biology , you 'd be hard pressed to even begin to quantify it 's beauty and complexity . The fact that a subset of micro-biology happens to congregate into multi-cellular organisms for 'communal living ' has both advantages and disadvantages ( microbes will survive global warming , will we ? ) . With multi-cellular life , there 's sex and sexless reproduction ... Again , the conception ( from a mechanical perspective ) is all but meaningless . So to give significance to conception reveals several things about the promoter : 1 ) There is little appreciation , or at least little awareness of the scope of complexities ( i.e . how primitive humans and our brains are compared to the mechanics of our micro-biological constituents ) 2 ) There is little appreciation , or at least little awareness of the insignificance of conception as a process ( it merely promotes genetic diversity without the aid of external agents like viruses ) 3 ) There is likely an overt indoctrination of a spiritual element to conception/birth - cognitive dissidence is common where a decision that you 've made earlier in your life ( i.e . that the church is a good source of wisdom ) preempts future decisions , even in the face of new logical evidence . It follows that 'life ' as is primitively portrayed in the `` pro-life `` , `` pro-abortion `` debate neglects the fact that we are not individuals , but a collective of billions of life-forms . Many of which dedicate their brief life to specific mechanical functions ( formation of skin , hair , red-blood-cells , gametes , etc ) . Cells regularly 'commit suicide ' for the good of the collective ( they are programmed to do so ) . Thus the loss of a cell 's life is precious , to be honored , and for the purposes of our discussion , to be taken in context . A zygote is nothing more than a fraction of a second after a mechanical process of two would-be-dead gametes . There is no `` injection-of-a-soul `` . In Rush 's paradigm , I challenge you to know otherwise . There is no measureable change in energy/mass or even appearance . Nothing more than can be derived by watching individual molecular structures interacting with their otherwise boring chemical surroundings . A 'soul ' , as many would promote , must either be intrinsically present before the zygote or be non-existent . There is no measureable guidance ( no random operation - pure machine execution of pre-defined code sequences ) . And , FYI , the DNA is only a SMALL part of the code-sequencing . Each decade we discover new subtle aspects about micro-biology which humbles us in our lack of knowledge . The micro-biology-machine is glorious in it 's complexity . A 'soul ' as one can best be known could exist in the ancestry of micro-biology . The fore-bearers , a plausible architect . And in that vein , every cell that undergoes mitosis ( or meiosis in the formation of gametes ) is a subdivision of the ancestrial architecture . Not the formation of new 'life ' . Nothing changes from the moment prio to and there-after - conception . It is not important for this discussion to elaborate on the origins one way or another . My intent is to express the complete lack of appreciation for what is probably the most important thing humans will ever have the privledge of conceiving . That we truely are insignificant compared to this vast existence .. That we are happily living at the top of the food-chain and chain of understanding ( at least so far as we know there are no other being in our area with greater prowess ) . That we should be humble and respect 'life ' ( which hopefully I 've conveyed as greater than humanity by many orders of magnitude ) . That death is an intricate part of life .. That life MUST commit suicide for the benifit of the many in order for the aggregate to survive .. That given the power to decide who/what lives and dies is not unique to us - even the earliest mobile micro-biology wielded this power . That we must strive to only kill in balance and for the greater good . And from that greater good , abortion becomes a mechanical act with significance . Is the world a better place for the abortion ? Will life flourish because we 've chosen to exclude one lineage of genetic diversity from prospering ? I suggest that abortion can be part of the greater-good in many circumstances . To the same extent that not every sperm or egg is properly utilized .. The fact that some have unintentially become fertilized is irrelevant - to the same extent that a mechanical process is initiated unintentially ( like accidentally hitting the wrong button on the keyboard - you quickly hit the escape function to `` regain control `` ) .

5047,"""Have you ever explored micro-biology . It is the most amazing universe you 'd ever want to explore . It makes the macro-biology world look like lego blocks . If you 've ever looked up at the stars and stood in amazement , that 's childs play . Just a bunch of macro-scopic hyper-symmetric globules of matter interacting according to almost perfect text-book formulas . In the micro-biology world , we have almost no understanding of the complexities of interaction .. We have ZERO formulas that can predict appropriate interaction ( though we spend hundreds of billions of dollars trying 'guesswork ' in medical labs ) . micro-biology is the computer-programming world of individual atoms . The number of combinations of atomic interaction is mind-numbing - yet micro-biology has obviously harnessed certain useful patterns . Discovering DNA was like discovering that we can store programming code on electrical tape . That 's a great discovery , but that is a far cry from learning to create software artificial intelligence ( another area we 're probably 100 years away from ) . Defining 'life begins at conception ' is like saying that an airplane becomes an airplane when then contract is signed for a work-order . It 's a meaningless point in time relative to the MILLIONS of complex interactions that are necessary for an airplanes life-cycle . Conception is the formation of a zygote , two gametes that are wonderfully complex machines that come in contact in a VERY small subset of life forms ( most life-forms do not use sex-discrimination as a method of reproduction ) . If you looked at primitive single-celled micro-biology , you 'd be hard pressed to even begin to quantify it 's beauty and complexity . The fact that a subset of micro-biology happens to congregate into multi-cellular organisms for 'communal living ' has both advantages and disadvantages ( microbes will survive global warming , will we ? ) . With multi-cellular life , there 's sex and sexless reproduction ... Again , the conception ( from a mechanical perspective ) is all but meaningless . So to give significance to conception reveals several things about the promoter : 1 ) There is little appreciation , or at least little awareness of the scope of complexities ( i.e . how primitive humans and our brains are compared to the mechanics of our micro-biological constituents ) 2 ) There is little appreciation , or at least little awareness of the insignificance of conception as a process ( it merely promotes genetic diversity without the aid of external agents like viruses ) 3 ) There is likely an overt indoctrination of a spiritual element to conception/birth - cognitive dissidence is common where a decision that you 've made earlier in your life ( i.e . that the church is a good source of wisdom ) preempts future decisions , even in the face of new logical evidence . It follows that 'life ' as is primitively portrayed in the `` pro-life `` , `` pro-abortion `` debate neglects the fact that we are not individuals , but a collective of billions of life-forms . Many of which dedicate their brief life to specific mechanical functions ( formation of skin , hair , red-blood-cells , gametes , etc ) . Cells regularly 'commit suicide ' for the good of the collective ( they are programmed to do so ) . Thus the loss of a cell 's life is precious , to be honored , and for the purposes of our discussion , to be taken in context .

The short answer : I 'll care about the ban when it does violate the Constitution . Your not going to find anyone to challenge the law . Personally I will not carry a firearm to a highschool . That is my personal choice . The consequences to me if I screw up with a firearm are too great , at the same time I would not restrict any citizen who wants to do so . If I find the need to be at a highschool , I am hoping that a gunman is going to shoot a lot of kids before he shoots me . That is what happens to the rest of society when you stop people who want to carry firearms . The good people who want to carry , hope that a lot of other people are going to get shot first before it is thier turn . It does not even have to be a gun , it can be any weapon .

But even the shortest DNA strand needs proteins to help it replicate . This is the chicken-and-egg problem . There is a `` proteins first `` school . For example , Manfred Eigen of Germany 's Max Planck Institute says , `` There is no doubt that proteins , which are more easily formed , were first on the scene `` ( 11.5 ) . Of course , these first proteins must be much shorter than any used in life today , because of the sheer unlikelihood of forming useful long ones out of a soup of amino acids .

5294,"""Hey everyone im new to the whole creation vs evolution thing . I do n't really know where i stand but i have a question . In the theory of evolution , what did it all start with ? Was it hydrodgen atoms that created the big bang ? Sorry I 'm just trying to learn more .""","""There is not one theory , but a great many to choose from . If you 're talking about the origins of life , many evolutionists believe in abiogenesis - that life somehow just came about out of non-life . Some will say that evolution and abiogenesis are two distinct theories , but there 's a lot of cross-over ; begun with Charles Darwin himself who postulated a primordial soup . Miller-Urey did experiments to try to concoct how life began in a primordial soup of their own design . They failed in essence to demonstrate how life could emerge from non-life through natural means . ( Many work on the philosophy that life came about and evolved through naturalistic , or materialistic processes ) It leads people such as Nobel-winner Francis Crick to come up with certain strange notions ; Panspermia , of which , his version just shifts the problem , rather than answers it . ( see below under PANSPERMIA ) Intelligent Design theorists suggest that some intelligence ; possibly , but not exclusively a deity is behind nature ; that nature seems to have an order . Some here too casually dismiss ID from science but the door 's already open to science SETI looks for ID Cryptographers do to Forensic scientists do THEORIES OF LIFE ... PANSPERMIA Panspermia is the idea that life came from outer space . As with all theories this too is not homogenous . There 's a general panspermia theory , and a 'directed ' panspermia theory . The former is a belief that life came here by random chance , such as on a meteor . The later is that life came here at the behest of an intelligence - such as aliens directing ships to earth laden with the molecules of life . One idea is that the building blocks of life Â “ ... Bakes said nitrogenated aromatics exist throughout the Milky Way galaxy.Â ” http : //www.spacedaily.com/news/life-04zw.html `` Francis Crick also thinks that life on earth may have begun when aliens from another planet sent a rocket ship containing spores to seed the earth . This is no idle thought ; Crick first proposed it with chemist Leslie Orgel in 1973 in an article entitled `` Directed Panspermia `` in a professional science journal called Icarus . A decade later Crick wrote a book , Life Itself , reiterating the theory ; in a 1992 interview in Scientific American on the eve of the publication of his latest book , Crick reaffirmed that he things the theory is reasonable. `` ( Behe , M , `` Darwin 's Black Box `` , p238 ) which as I said , simply moves the problem to 'where did the aliens come from ? ' '' COMPLEXITY THEORY Stuart Kauffman , a theoretical biologist at the Sante Fe Institute , has put forth the idea that when the necessary elements of the cell formed in the primordial soup ( nucleotides , lipids , and amino acids ) , they were instantaneously integrated into a system , a system which we know as the cell ( Cohen , 1996 ) . Kauffman says this was not due to a miracle or chance , but was bound to occur . He rejects other scientists ' need to find some sort of genetic carrier like RNA or DNA , or even an aperiodic solid , saying that the life forms may have had no need for them . ( An aperiodic solid is one in which the atoms are arranged in some non-repeatable geometric pattern , such as a helix , that would allow for the variation within the structure that is necessary for genetic material ) . He believes that such genetic carriers could have evolved after the new life was already flourishing . Kauffman has even designed a computer model that shows that when a few organic molecules have developed some catalytic skills and reach the necessary level of diversity , then they spontaneously form an `` autocatalytic set `` ( a life form ) . His theory is based on the general complexity theory , which states that when a system reaches some critical level of complexity , it will naturally produce a degree of complex order ( 4 ) . `` http : //www.lifesci.utexas.edu/cours ... 2/JENNIFER.html A.

'' One of the features of science should be to be objective , `` but war metaphors are precisely the opposite , he noted . '' These terms have an intention , they are sort of modern propaganda. `` Indeed , when Nottingham 's James referred publicly to the coming `` post-antibiotic apocalypse , `` the UK 's Chief Nursing Officer accused him of sensationalism and scaremongering . Scientists who frame problems in a militaristic manner also likely have a drastically limited perception of the problem and how to tackle it , noted Berkeley cognitive linguist George Lakoff .

With bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , however , `` You have to look at multiple factors , and not just in terms of attack and defend , `` she said . Indeed , some argue that our militaristic use of antimicrobial agents has , by introducing new selection pressures , only made pathogens stronger , while a consideration of other factors -- like host behavior and the social and physical environment -- could offer better solutions . Brendon Larson , assistant professor of environment and resources studies at the University of Waterloo in Canada , argued the same of `` invasion biology , `` where scientists may automatically assume an invading species must be removed . But in some cases , a sustainable relationship makes more sense -- for example , removal of the `` invading `` Himalayan blackberry from parts of California hurt the native tricolored blackbird , which used the plants as nesting habitats . '' We 're entrenched in a particular way of seeing this situation , that [ invasive species are ] enemies , they 're bad and we have to get rid of them , `` Larson told The Scientist . Indeed , according to Larson , the modern use of military terminology may have contributed to US President George W. Bush 's decision to merge part of the government agency responsible for invasive species into the Department of Homeland Security .

He said : `` This is a sophisticated army with astonishing weapons . And each time we develop something new , [ bacteria ] develop a defense for it. `` The use of such war metaphors in science and medicine is not new . As early as 1934 , the British Medical Journal wrote about the `` War Against Cancer , `` a phrase we still often hear . But today , militaristic language pops up in almost every scientific domain : conservation biology ( `` invasive species , `` `` biosecurity `` ) ; global warming ( `` global war on global warming `` ) ; and biomedicine ( `` killer cells , `` `` hitting multiple targets `` ) . The attraction to such language is understandable , as it draws attention , and perhaps even funding ( who can forget US President Richard Nixon 's declaration to `` conquer `` cancer in his 1971 state of the union address , since which hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into cancer research ? ) . Still , some scientists worry that the use of war metaphors has negative effects on both science and the scientists who adopt the language . For instance , scientists who use military terms may risk losing credibility , warned Erik von Elm , an epidemiologist at the University of Berne in Switzerland and co-author of a recent Lancet correspondence on military metaphors .

I point this out not to absolve pro-choice groups of guilt , but to say : Before pointing fingers , make sure your own house is in order . This entire article is also something of a strawman argument as well . The argument that illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortion is banned is not a justification for legal abortions ( per se ) . As I see it , since illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortions are banned , the complaint is that pro-life people would rather see more women hurt ( and yes , more women are hurt with illegal abortion than legal ) than actually solve the problems with society . To ban abortion and declare the problem solved is extremely irresponsible and does nothing to help society or women . If you would , chloe , please link to the study the article mentions about the number of illegal abortions ? IÂ ’ m amazed they managed to eek out numbers , given that not even the CDC has exact figures since illegal abortions were not tracked . The most compelling evidence IÂ ’ ve seen looked at the birth rates for various ethnic groups the years previous to abortion being legal to the years after , corrected for various factors such as better birth control methods . They found little change in the birth rates , indicating the number of abortions most likely did not increase or decrease . Yes , I know pro-choice groups mislead with stats and figures .

But once Langbehn and the children arrived at the hospital the hospital refused to accept information from her about PondsÂ ’ s medical history . Langbehn says she was informed that she was in an antigay city and state , and she could expect to receive no information or acknowledgment as family . A doctor finally spoke with Janice telling her that there was no chance of recovery . Other than one five minute visit , which was orchestrated by a Catholic priest at LangbehnÂ ’ s request to perform last rites , and despite the doctorÂ ’ s acknowledgement that no medical reason existed to prevent visitation , neither she nor her children were allowed to see Pond until nearly eight hours after their arrival . Soon after Pond ' Â ’ s death , Langbehn tried to get her death certificate in order to get life insurance and Social Security benefits for their children .
