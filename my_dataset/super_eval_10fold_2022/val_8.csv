768,"""Gun Lobby Promoted `` Final War `` Against Federal Government National Rifle Association ( NRA ) Led Fight , Warning `` Final War Has Begun `` Soldier of Fortune Publisher Robert K. Brown Also Serves on NRA Board of Directors Anti-government writings in Soldier of Fortune magazine regarding the federal government 's 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco being presented during the sentencing portion of the McVeigh trial were only a small sample of the language of war offered by America 's gun lobby to its `` freedom fighters `` prior to the 1995 Oklahoma bombing . In the period leading up to the bombing , violent , written attacks on the federal government were led by the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) , which announced in its magazines that `` The Final War Has Begun. `` Soldier of Fortune publisher Robert K. Brown also serves on the NRA board of directors . McVeigh himself is a former NRA member . Attacks made on the federal government by the NRA in this `` war `` included : In his 1994 book Guns , Crime , and Freedom , NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre compared the final FBI assault on the Branch Davidian compound to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising , stating , `` What occurred is reminiscent of the stand-off at the Warsaw ghetto . The Jews , whose religious views were unpopular with the Nazis , were trapped inside the ghetto and had ten handguns . When the Nazi soldiers tried to take the Jews from the ghetto , shooting started , the soldiers fell back , and the siege began . In the end , the Nazis burned down the ghetto to end the tiring siege. `` An April 1995 American Rifleman article referred to federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms agents as `` armed terrorists `` who are `` harassing , intimidating and hurting honest citizens `` with `` the brute force of unchecked , renegade federal power. `` The article added , `` The terror often comes at the hands of BATF agents clad in ninja black , but the terror does n't stop there. `` Previously in direct mail , Wayne LaPierre had referred to federal agents as `` jack-booted government thugs. `` In the June 1994 American Rifleman , the NRA warned of an alleged gun control `` Master Plan `` that employed the `` the fascist language of Stalin , Hitler , Castro and Saddam Hussein. `` In January 1994 NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre warned , `` We have repeatedly warned this assault was coming , and the time of reckoning is here . If you or your children want to own a gun as free American citizens in the years ahead , then prepare to stand and fight with us now. `` In an October 1993 American Rifleman attack on the Federal Bureau of Investigation which featured goose-stepping military personnel , the NRA asked , `` What 's the first step to a police state ? `` In the ad Wayne LaPierre urged readers to , `` Take back your government and save your guns `` and warned that the FBI 's `` extremist leadership is determined to become a political anti-gun police force . That 's a line they can not cross . The FBI can not be deployed to terrorize honest gun owners .... `` These and other examples of inflammatory language employed by the NRA in its attack on the federal government found by the Violence Policy Center are available to the news media .

They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature , by the hand of the divinity itself , and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power . The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans ' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process . To the Federalists , those who favored the Constitution , a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states ; also , most states had bills of rights . To the Anti-Federalists , those who opposed the Constitution , the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable . Throughout the ratification process , individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights .""","""Ninth Amendment - Unenumerated Rights""",DISAGREE,"""Alexander Hamilton 1775""","""Ninth Amendment"""

1058,"""Washington ( CNN ) -- Nearly 180 Department of Homeland Security weapons were lost -- some falling into the hands of criminals -- after officers left them in restrooms , vehicles and other public places , according to an inspector general report . The officers , with Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement , `` did not always sufficiently safeguard their firearms and , as a result , lost a significant number of firearms `` between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2008 , the report said .

Of those , 36 were lost because of circumstances beyond officers ' control -- for instance , ICE lost a firearm during an assault on an officer . Another 28 were lost even though officers had stored them in lockboxes or safes . But 74 percent , or 179 guns , were lost `` because officers did not properly secure them , `` the report said . Following a review of the draft report in December , Homeland Security took steps to implement its recommendations and overhaul its property management policy , according to a response in the report . A department spokeswoman did not immediately return a call from CNN Thursday seeking comment . The report concluded the department did not have specific procedures and policies in place regarding firearms .

1058,"""Washington ( CNN ) -- Nearly 180 Department of Homeland Security weapons were lost -- some falling into the hands of criminals -- after officers left them in restrooms , vehicles and other public places , according to an inspector general report . The officers , with Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement , `` did not always sufficiently safeguard their firearms and , as a result , lost a significant number of firearms `` between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2008 , the report said . In all , 243 firearms were lost in both agencies during that period , according to the January report from Inspector General Richard Skinner . Of those , 36 were lost because of circumstances beyond officers ' control -- for instance , ICE lost a firearm during an assault on an officer . Another 28 were lost even though officers had stored them in lockboxes or safes . But 74 percent , or 179 guns , were lost `` because officers did not properly secure them , `` the report said . Following a review of the draft report in December , Homeland Security took steps to implement its recommendations and overhaul its property management policy , according to a response in the report . A department spokeswoman did not immediately return a call from CNN Thursday seeking comment . The report concluded the department did not have specific procedures and policies in place regarding firearms . '' Instead , DHS relied on its components to augment its general property management policies and procedures with specific guidance for safeguarding and controlling firearms , `` it said . '' Although some component policies and procedures for safeguarding firearms were sufficient , personnel did not always follow them. `` The inspector general cited several examples of `` inappropriate practices. `` A customs officer , for instance , left a firearm in an idling vehicle in the parking lot of a convenience store . The vehicle was stolen while the officer was inside . '' A local law enforcement officer later recovered the firearm from a suspected gang member and drug smuggler , `` the report said . In addition , an ICE officer left an M-4 rifle and a shotgun unsecured in a closet at his home . Both weapons were stolen in a burglary and later recovered from a felon , according to the report . Another officer left his firearm in the restroom of a fast-food restaurant , and it was gone when he returned . '' Other CBP and ICE officers left firearms in places such as a fast food restaurant parking lot , a bowling alley and a clothing store , `` the report said . '' Although our review focused on CBP and ICE , other components described similar incidents . For example , a TSA officer left a firearm in a lunch box on the front seat of an unlocked vehicle ; the officer realized the firearm was stolen when he returned to the vehicle two days later , `` said the report . '' Officers may have prevented many of these losses had they exercised reasonable care when storing their weapons. `` Of the 179 lost because of laxity , 120 were reported stolen and 59 as lost , the report said . That resulted from the agencies ' lack of guidance on a standard method for classifying and reporting lost firearms , as well as `` a common perception among officers that reporting a stolen firearm was more acceptable than reporting a lost firearm . '' Although CBP and ICE reported 120 firearms as stolen , our analysis showed that these firearms were lost ( stolen ) because officers left the firearms unsecured , `` according to the report . '' All 179 losses may have been prevented had the officers properly secured their firearms. `` The department had about 188,500 weapons in its inventory as of last summer , the report said . The majority are assigned to Customs and Border Protection and ICE officers , but others are carried by agencies including the U.S. Coast Guard , the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center .""","""Well that 's a real holy XXXX moment right there .

1095,"""Challenged by Creationists , Museums Answer Back By CORNELIA DEAN Published : September 20 , 2005 ITHACA , N.Y. - Lenore Durkee , a retired biology professor , was volunteering as a docent at the Museum of the Earth here when she was confronted by a group of seven or eight people , creationists eager to challenge the museum exhibitions on evolution . They peppered Dr. Durkee with questions about everything from techniques for dating fossils to the second law of thermodynamics , their queries coming so thick and fast that she found it hard to reply . After about 45 minutes , `` I told them I needed to take a break , `` she recalled . '' My mouth was dry. `` That encounter and others like it provided the impetus for a training session here in August . Dr. Durkee and scores of other volunteers and staff members from the museum and elsewhere crowded into a meeting room to hear advice from the museum director , Warren D. Allmon , on ways to deal with visitors who reject settled precepts of science on religious grounds . Similar efforts are under way or planned around the country as science museums and other institutions struggle to contend with challenges to the theory of evolution that they say are growing common and sometimes aggressive . One company , called B.C . Tours `` because we are biblically correct , `` even offers escorted visits to the Denver Museum of Science and Nature . Participants hear creationists ' explanations for the exhibitions . So officials like Judy Diamond , curator of public programs at the University of Nebraska State Museum in Lincoln , are trying to meet such challenges head-on . Dr. Diamond is working on evolution exhibitions financed by the National Science Foundation that will go on long-term display at six museums of natural history from Minnesota to Texas . The program includes training for docents and staff members . '' The goal is to understand the controversies , so that people are better able to handle them as they come up , `` she said . '' Museums , as a field , have recognized we need to take a more proactive role in evolution education. `` Dr. Allmon , who directs the Paleontological Research Institution , an affiliate of Cornell University , began the training session here in September with statistics from Gallup Polls : 54 percent of Americans do not believe that human beings evolved from earlier species , and although almost half believe that Darwin has been proved right , slightly more disagree . '' Just telling them they are wrong is not going to be effective , `` he said . Instead , he told the volunteers that when they encounter religious fundamentalists they should emphasize that science museums live by the rules of science . They seek answers in nature to questions about nature , they look for explanations that can be tested by experiment and observation in the material world , and they understand that all scientific knowledge is provisional - capable of being overturned when better answers are discovered . '' Is it against all religion ? `` he asked . '' No . But it is against some religions. `` There is more than one type of creationist , he said : `` thinking creationists who want to know answers , and they are willing to listen , even if they go away unconvinced `` and `` people who for whatever reason are here to bother you , to trap you , to bludgeon you. `` Those were the type of people who confronted Dr. Durkee , a former biology professor at Grinnell College in Iowa . The encounter left her discouraged . '' It is no wonder that many biologists will simply refuse to debate creationists or I.D.ers , `` she said , using the abbreviation for intelligent design , a cousin of creationism . '' It is as if they are n't listening. `` Dr. Allmon says even trained scientists like Dr. Durkee can benefit from explicit advice about dealing with religious challenges to science exhibitions . '' There is an art , a script that is very , very helpful , `` he said . A pamphlet handed out at the training session provides information on the scientific method , the theory of evolution and other basic information . It offers suggestions on replying to frequently raised challenges like `` Is there lots of evidence against evolution ? `` ( The answer begins , simply , `` No. `` ) When talking to visitors about evolution , the pamphlet advises , `` do n't avoid using the word. `` Rehearse answers to frequently asked questions , because `` you 'll be more comfortable when you sound like you know what you 're talking about. `` Dr. Allmon told his audience to `` be firm and clear , not defensive. `` The pamphlet says that if all else fails , and docents find themselves in an unpleasant confrontation , they excuse themselves by saying , `` I have to go to the restroom. `` Eugenie C. Scott , who directs the National Center for Science Education and is conducting training sessions for Dr. Diamond 's program , said that within the last year or so efforts to train museum personnel and volunteers on evolution and related topics had substantially increased . '' This seems to be a cottage industry now , `` Dr. Scott said . Robert M. West , a paleontologist and former science museum director who is now a consultant to museums , said several institutions were intensifying the docents ' training `` so they are comfortable with the concepts , not just the material but the intellectual , philosophical background - and they know their administrations are going to support them if someone criticizes them. `` At the Denver science museum , the staff and docents often encounter groups from B.C . Tours , which for 15 years has offered tours of the museum based on literal readings of the Bible . The group embraces young-earth creationism , the view that the earth and its plants , animals and people were created in a matter of days a few thousand years ago . '' We present both sides from an objective perspective and let the students decide for themselves , `` said Rusty Carter , an operator of the group . Mr. Carter praised the museum , saying it had been `` very professional and accommodating , even though they do not support us. `` A typical group might have 30 or 40 people , he added . Kirk Johnson , a paleontologist who is the chief curator at the museum , was philosophical about the group . '' It 's interesting to walk along with them , `` he said . Participants pay the admission fee and have as much right as anyone else to be in the museum , Dr. Johnson said , but sometimes `` we have to restrain our docents from interacting with them. `` John G. West , a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute , whose researchers endorse intelligent design , said he was not aware of organized efforts to challenge museum exhibitions on evolution . He added , `` It is not unheard of for museum exhibits to be wrong scientifically. `` Dr. Scott , who trained as a physical anthropologist , said that in training docents she emphasized `` how the public understands or misunderstands evolution and some of the misconceptions they come in with. `` She hopes to combat the idea that people must choose between science and faith - `` that you are either a good Christian creationist or an evil atheist evolutionist. `` '' It 's your job , `` she told docents , `` not to slam the door in the face of a believer. `` At the American Museum of Natural History , which is about to open what it describes as `` the most in-depth exhibition ever `` on Darwin and his work , curators and other staff members instruct volunteer `` explainers `` on the science behind its exhibitions , according to Stephen Reichl , a spokesman . If visitors challenge the presentations , the explainers are instructed to listen `` and then explain the science and the evidence. `` Sarah Fiorello , an environmental educator at the Finger Lakes State Parks Region who took part in the Ithaca training session in August , said she was now prepared to take the same approach . When she describes the region 's geological history on tours of its gorges , visitors often object - as even a member of her family once did - that `` it does not say that in the Bible. `` Now , she said , she will tell them , `` The landscape tells a story based on geological events , based on science. `` Dr. Durkee also said she found the session helpful . '' When you are in a museum , you ca n't antagonize people , `` she said . '' Your job is to help them , to explain your point of view , but respect theirs .

1336,"""Published on Monday , November 16 , 2009 by The Alburquerque Journal Health Deform by Carol Miller A very complex , mandatory private insurance scheme recently passed the U.S. House . The public is being overwhelmed by sound bites on one hand about how great it is , on the other , how terrible . We are hearing few of the details that are actually in the bill . Having read the bill , it is clear now that what started as health reform has emerged from the political process as health `` deform , `` building on the worst , not the best of the current system . It is still a toss-up as to whether the Senate will pass any bill this year . However , due to intense political pressure , the Senate is likely to pass a bill that will make some House provisions better and others worse . What actually comes out in the final conference-committee bill is anyone 's guess at this point - so little time , so many deals still to be made , so many political funders to be appeased . A careful analysis of the bill shows that it is designed more for political goals than to eliminate financial barriers to health care . For example , the actual coverage does n't even begin until 2013 , opportunistically after the next presidential election , in 2012 . Run on having accomplished `` historic reform `` but before anyone actually experiences how bad it is ? How cynical is that ? Yes , there are some good provisions . The best relate to improving existing programs like the Indian Health Service , community health centers , and health professionals education and training ; all are important for New Mexico . But there bad provisions , which comprise most of the 1,990 pages of the bill . Five key reasons this legislation must be stopped : & # 8226 ; If passed , this law will move the U.S. farther from universal health care , making it harder than ever to accomplish health care justice in the future . If Congress does not have the courage to stand up to the private insurance industry now , it will be even more difficult in the future , especially after giving the industry trillions of new dollars through this terrible legislation . Let 's call this what it is : another corporate bailout on the backs of working people . Pay attention to your federal representatives as they carefully talk about `` health insurance reform. `` They are n't talking about health reform any more . Congress could have defended and built up a system based on popular , high-quality government-run health programs like the military and veterans fully socialized health systems or Medicare , a single-payer program . Instead , the president and Congress let the corporations and government-haters take control of the agenda . & # 8226 ; The legislation institutionalizes permanent inequality in health care . Unlike Medicare where all beneficiaries have a single plan , this bill further divides the U.S. system into tiers based on ability to pay . It creates basic , enhanced , premium and premium-plus plans . A basic plan will provide only 70 percent of the coverage of a `` reference benefit package , `` one that includes even fewer services than most insured people have today . The bill does n't even mention coverage for essential services like vision and adult dental care except in the most costly premium-plus plan . & # 8226 ; Out-of-pocket costs remain sky high . Everyone will be required to pay monthly insurance premiums . Some low-wage workers will receive taxpayer subsidies on a sliding scale . The lowest income people will have full subsidies . But remember , this is not money for care , it is support only to buy insurance . Almost everyone will have to meet a deductible , capped in the bill at $ 1,500 a year , higher than most insurance-plan deductibles today . On top of this , insurance companies can charge even more under various `` cost sharing `` schemes for items like co-pays and co-insurance . The bill puts a cap on cost sharing , but the total amount is obscene . The cap for an individual is $ 5,000 a year and for a family it is $ 10,000 before the plan must cover everything . Well , not exactly everything . Even after paying this huge amount of money , the legislation still allows the corporations to make us pay , billing for non-network providers and , since it is not a comprehensive benefit package , we are still on our own to pay for health care that the plans refuse to cover . The legislation creates a law to let these corporations increase what they charge people as they get older . In fact , they can be charged up to twice as much as younger people for identical coverage . & # 8226 ; The legislation makes it illegal to not buy health insurance . The penalties are described in a section of the legislation called `` Shared Responsibility. `` This will let the IRS impose a tax of up to 2.5 percent of modified adjusted gross income for not having health insurance . People on the financial edge , people fighting foreclosure to stay in their homes or people who are unemployed all or part of a year will not be able to afford the insurance premiums or the penalties for not having insurance . & # 8226 ; We will all be drowning in paperwork , which will continue to drive up administrative costs . Right now , insurance administrative waste is about 30 percent of every health care dollar- or about $ 1 billion a day . Adding more people to an insurance-based system will result in even more money going into this bottomless pit . As if this is n't bad enough , the government will be setting up many new agencies to oversee the whole process including , at the top , the Orwellian Health Choices Administration , headed by the Health Choices Commissioner . This is not an agency to help us make health care choices , but to choose a health insurance company . The IRS will play a very large role in everything from certifying our income for subsidies to monitoring and taxing people who do n't buy insurance . Health Insurance Exchanges will be created across the country with at least one in every state offering both Web sites and telephone assistance . This is where we will go every year to pick our insurance plan in an open enrollment period of at least 30 days between September and November . We can add this unpleasant task to all of our other fall chores . It is hard to imagine the chaos and wasted resources with the entire country picking insurance plans at the same time , attended by marketing , billboards , advertising and misinformation . We will gamble as we choose a plan , decide which corporation will be the best for us , hoping we pick one that is not dominated by corporate bureaucrats focused on rationing care to maximize their profits . It is not an easy task and if a wrong plan is selected , we are stuck for a year , until the next national open enrollment cycle . The United States can do better . We can build on a strengthened and well-funded Medicare program . In Medicare , when a person reached the age of eligibility or is determined to qualify because they have a permanent disability , they are in , and there is no re-enrollment . Imagine real reform , as simple as adding people ages 55 to 65 years old to Medicare in 2010 , 35-55 in 2011 , and so on until everyone is included by 2013 . The bills that promote this kind of reform are under 200 pages , they are simple to implement , cost effective and equitable . Choose a doctor , choose a hospital when needed and let the government pay the bills . Everyone in one system . That is what real health reform would look like .

1336,"""Published on Monday , November 16 , 2009 by The Alburquerque Journal Health Deform by Carol Miller A very complex , mandatory private insurance scheme recently passed the U.S. House . The public is being overwhelmed by sound bites on one hand about how great it is , on the other , how terrible . We are hearing few of the details that are actually in the bill . Having read the bill , it is clear now that what started as health reform has emerged from the political process as health `` deform , `` building on the worst , not the best of the current system . It is still a toss-up as to whether the Senate will pass any bill this year . However , due to intense political pressure , the Senate is likely to pass a bill that will make some House provisions better and others worse . What actually comes out in the final conference-committee bill is anyone 's guess at this point - so little time , so many deals still to be made , so many political funders to be appeased . A careful analysis of the bill shows that it is designed more for political goals than to eliminate financial barriers to health care . For example , the actual coverage does n't even begin until 2013 , opportunistically after the next presidential election , in 2012 . Run on having accomplished `` historic reform `` but before anyone actually experiences how bad it is ? How cynical is that ? Yes , there are some good provisions . The best relate to improving existing programs like the Indian Health Service , community health centers , and health professionals education and training ; all are important for New Mexico . But there bad provisions , which comprise most of the 1,990 pages of the bill . Five key reasons this legislation must be stopped : & # 8226 ; If passed , this law will move the U.S. farther from universal health care , making it harder than ever to accomplish health care justice in the future .

2555,"""Read these storys of self defence and then tell me Brady how you can justify these The injustice of the British ban on self defense Making matters worse , the British legal system seems to treat crime victims worse than it treats the criminals who attacked them . An example is the Tony Martin case : Tony Martin was a farmer , whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times . Martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar . When a pair of burglars broke in while he was home , Martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun . The 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras was killed , and 33-year-old Brendon Fearon was wounded in the leg . Later on that day , the police arrested Tony Martin and charged him with the crimes of murder and wounding with intent . At trial , Martin argued that he had acted in self defense , but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee . He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison , although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence . The surviving criminal , who had over 30 criminal convictions , then sued Tony Martin for the injury he suffered during the burglary . The parole board refused to grant Tony Martin an early release because he Â “ has shown no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglars.Â ” Martin was eventually released from prison after spending years in prison and being vilified by the anti-gun groups in the UK for shooting criminals who had broken into his home . Another example , from 2009 , also shows how the British legal system favors criminals over their victims : A millionaire businessman has been jailed for attacking a man who held his family hostage in their own home Â– while the criminal went free . Munir Hussain , who was threatened at knifepoint and tied up by a gang of masked men in his living room last year , was told he must go to prison for 30 months to preserve Â “ civilised societyÂ ” . But Walid Salem , a criminal with more than 50 convictions , was handed a two-year supervision order for his role in the break-in at an earlier hearing . He was one of three men who ambushed Mr Hussain , his wife and children as they returned to their home in High Wycombe , Bucks , on Sept 3 last year after attending Ramadan prayers at their local mosque , Reading Crown Court heard . Their hands were tied behind their backs and they were forced to crawl from room to room before being forced to lie down in the living room . But when HussainÂ ’ s teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm , he seized his chance and turned on his captors . . .

An example is the Tony Martin case : Tony Martin was a farmer , whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times . Martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar . When a pair of burglars broke in while he was home , Martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun . The 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras was killed , and 33-year-old Brendon Fearon was wounded in the leg .

At trial , Martin argued that he had acted in self defense , but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee . He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison , although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence .

None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any `` natural `` rights . They recognize such rights , but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights . Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or `` self-evident `` , but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day , as expressed in the writings of Locke , Montesquieu , Rousseau , Madison , Hamilton , and others , which discussed `` natural rights `` in some detail . Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights . That has turned out to have been a good idea > ( 2 ) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government . This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted , which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution .""","""And Hamilton 's writings in Federalist 28 .

3927,"""You are so right-on in what you say ! In a Sunday school at a church I formerly attended , an elder of the church remarked that his `` faith was strengthened `` by the `` evidence `` afforded by recent archaeological discoveries in the middle east . In a tone I now rather regret , I blurted out two things ... ... How weak was your faith before ? and ... If the `` evidence `` had gone 'the other way , ' would your faith then have been weakened ? His answer for the second question was a simple 'no , ' which suggests to me that the sense of the term 'evidence ' he was employing was not the same sense you 'd expect a scientist to use . His response to the first was problematic , and interesting . '' My faith , `` he said , has always been -- then he used the most interesting word -- `` complete. `` But he had taken sufficient offence already , it seemed , that I pressed no further . I wish sometimes that I 'd asked : If your faith was `` always complete , `` did the archaeological evidence make it `` more complete `` ? And , if so , does your sense of 'complete ' match that word 's usual application ? I do not quite grasp the notion of there being `` scientific evidence `` for a proposition within the realm of faith . I do not mean to suggest that my claim that scientific and religious propositions reside in different discourses disposes of all worry or complaint . Activity in one realm may be felt in the other . But , re : evolution , I think this ... Given convincing evidence that , say , the earth is billions of years old , not thousands -- a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs -- my worry is not that the 'Biblical account ' of creation is wrong , erroneous , falsified ... but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what , now , that account 's meaning is , what it affirms . Scientific discovery , evidence , and discourse thus do n't `` disprove the Bible. `` Rather , they serve to displace interpretations of biblical text , and give us cause -- I call it : opportunity -- to find new , richer meaning in scripture . I 'm often embarrassed by the smallness and brittleness of certain Christians ' interpretations . Emphasizing the 'literal , ' as some do -- a very problematic term in itself -- some Christians see in , for example , the Genesis `` tree of the knowledge of good and evil `` nothing more than a tree . A biological tree . Pear tree . Peach tree . Apple tree . Tree of the knowledge of good and evil . Albeit a special species , nonetheless a species . And , for them , there you go -- Eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed species , and that 's your story . Lost , in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation , is the richness of metaphor the story offers . Metaphor , again and again , is variously deliberately denigrated or unconsciously eclipsed , in the readings of certain Christians . Science is not the only victim of such cheesily 'literal ' interpretation . Christian faith -- at least , the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor , parable , legend and myth , and the transformative power that arises from those aspects of scripture -- is equally victim .

What an incompetent designer God is .""","""So , you think there is a God ? Bad design does not equate to no design . It really is a poor argument . Much of the force of Darwin 's arguments deal with bad design . I invite anyone to post any of Darwin 's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of `` bad `` design . That said , consider this , your car is said to operate at 25 % fuel efficiency . One could claim then the car is 75 % bad design , therefore it is not designed , and if it is , certainly not by anyone of any intelligence . Your audio CD 's have Reed-Solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting . Cleary this is `` bad design `` that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place . Same with modems and host of other devices . Clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design , the designers must be clueless ! Poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes . Clearly a drama ( even a divine drama ) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story . All the characters should be Pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending . Life and the Divine drama , like CD 's and cars , are clearly not designed , or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence , because of all the bad design woven into the designs . The reason audio CD 's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction ( somewhat like us reading someone 's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors ) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible . The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem . The Mp3 's and JPEGS are even more `` error `` prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture , but the goal was not fidelity but compactness . A similar consideration is for the 75 % inefficiency for cars . The goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost , etc. , not fuel efficiency . The point is `` bad `` design , in the grand scheme of things , might not be bad design after all . The high rate of sickness and death , the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the Designer is unwise , any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio CD suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent . Origin of Species Chapter 13 : There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject ; namely , the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class , but of the different parts or organs in the same individual . Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae . The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous . We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans . It is familiar to almost every one , that in a flower the relative position of the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils , as well as their intimate structure , are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves , arranged in a spire . In monstrous plants , we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another ; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals , and in flowers , that organs which when mature become extremely different , are at an early stage of growth exactly alike . How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation ! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone ? As Owen has remarked , the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals , will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds . Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat , used as they are for such totally different purposes ? Why should one crustacean , which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts , consequently always have fewer legs ; or conversely , those with many legs have simpler mouths ? Why should the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils in any individual flower , though fitted for such widely different purposes , be all constructed on the same pattern ? On the theory of natural selection , we can satisfactorily answer these questions . Homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by Owen who rather despised Darwin and his ideas . Darwin tries to argue why a Designer would not use the same for the same function . He says homology is evidence of an unwise design . The premise is a Creator would n't be so inefficient . But , unless one has a handle on the teleological goal , one is free to fabricate all manner of `` bad design `` arguments ( for example read/write errors in audio CD 's or fuel inefficient cars ) . The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life , and that life could not have evolved . Like a great novel , the `` imperfections `` of biology are part of a larger plot . It is turning out , Darwin 's argument from homology is a concept in crisis .""",DISAGREE,"""And this is looking at just heart development , never mind the numerous malformations""","""The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem ."""

Post , at 8 . But if a prologue can be used only to clarify an ambiguous operative provision , surely the first step must be to determine whether the operative provision is ambiguous . It might be argued , we suppose , that the prologue itself should be one of the factors that go into the determination of whether the operative provision is ambiguous & # 8212 ; but that would cause the prologue to be used to produce ambiguity rather than just to resolve it . In any event , even if we considered the prologue along with the operative provision we would reach the same result we do today , since ( as we explain ) our interpretation of & # 8220 ; the right of the people to keep and bear arms & # 8221 ; furthers the purpose of an effective militia no less than ( indeed , more than ) the dissent & # 8217 ; s interpretation .

The ardour with which this evidence is brandished is , however , misleading . In only a handful of studies , using specific strains of bacteria with specific genetic features under specific environmental circumstances , have specific adaptive mutations seemed to occur with anomalous frequency . There is no suggestion that these cases are in any way generally representative , and even if the results were being interpreted correctly , the idea that they constitute evidence for a pan-species mechanism of internally directed evolution is , unfortunately , wishful thinking . But what of these rare anomalous cases ? The most famous was reported by J. Cairns and P. L. Foster , in which a dish of starving , non-growing E-coli ( a particular strain with a Lac- mutation ) appeared to preferentially induce a reversion mutation ( to Lac+ ) in order to enable growth when the only source of energy was lactose . Moreover , the mutation did not occur with such frequency if lactose was not present , if there was another growth-inhibiting factor in play , or if food sources other than lactose were available . On top of that , although the adapted bacteria showed evidence of accumulating other non-selected mutations , it was nowhere near enough to explain the rate of adaptive mutation , and the bacteria which did n't adapt showed no accumulation of unselected mutations at all ! Understandably , this looked to them , and other people at the time , like a pretty cut'n'dried example of an environmentally-or-organismically induced adaptive mutation . However , the nagging problem remained that this event was completely unprecedented , and was not observed in the general case of bacteria under starvation conditions . Why was this strain of bacteria so good at inducing this particular reversion mutation in just those circumstances ? The answer , as it turned out , was that the experimental assumption of 'no growth ' taking place in the e-coli colony was in error . The strain of e-coli used in the experiment had a 'leaky ' ( inefficient ) mutant Lac allele , with only 1 % to 2 % of the normal ability to process lactose . That 1 % to 2 % was then deliberately 'smothered ' by the experimenters through the addition of scavenger cells which mopped up the product of what little lactose the e-coli could process , effectively halting their growth . Because the later , visible growing colonies of e-coli had a reversion mutation to lac+ , the experimenters deduced that mutation was required for growth to be possible . However , what they did not take into account at the time was that during normal growth prior to incubation on the test medium , a small proportion of the e-coli colony experienced a duplication of the leaky lac gene . This mutation conferred no advantage - until the colony was plated on lactose . Now , the second copy of the gene increased the total amount of lactose they could process beyond the ability of the scavenger cells to inhibit growth , and the e-coli could ( slowly ) grow and divide . Within these slow-growing microcolonies , selection favoured those cells which experienced further lac- duplications . And the more lac- duplications a cell has , the more likely one of them will experience a reversion mutation to lac+ , explaining the apparently anomalous frequency of that particular mutation . When this happens , cell growth rate jumps considerably - but now it is the additional lac- genes which are holding the organism back , destabilising the chromosome and tying up resources which could be more efficiently processed by the lac+ gene . Selection now favours those lac+ revertants who lose the unstable lac- duplications . By the time the microcolonies become visible to the naked eye , they consist almost entirely of lac+ revertants . This hypothesis agrees with all observations related to the earlier experiments , and was verified in a number of ways , including repeating the experiment with a colony composed entirely of duplicate lac- bacteria , increasing the number of microcolonies 100-fold , which tallies with the ~1 % background rate of chromosomal duplications in those bacteria . Also , bacteria in the late-arriving microcolonies were observed to possess residual duplicate lac- genes . In short , the results of the experiment agree completely with classical evolutionary theory . It should be noted , by the way , that in addition to the late-arriving 'directed mutation ' microcolonies that causes such a stir , the original experimenters also observed the expected number of early-appearing colonies from pre-plating revertant mutants , a la L & amp ; D. EDIT : Reading further around the subject , it seems no stress-induced hypermutable state was involved either . Apparently , 10-20 % of the bacteria with lac- duplications also possessed 'dinB ' ( a mutation-promoting gene apparently , though it 's beyond the scope of my research here ) on the same plasmid . The mutagen 'came along for the ride ' so to speak , as selection favoured the duplication of that section of DNA , and induced hgher rates of mutation in - yep - 10-20 % of the adaptive population . So not only was the hypermutational state of that subpopulation not the cause of the adaptive mutation ( clearly , since the other 80-90 % of adaptation happened without it ) , it was actually harmful .

It is an approach that has gained a powerful foothold in the Obama White House . '' We 're human . And there are lots of other influences that go into what we do , `` said Kenneth Baer , a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget . '' One of the most important insights of behavioral economics is that we 're not all rational maximizers calculating our cost and benefits and doing things like a computer. `` As the proposed $ 900 billion health-care legislation inches toward the finish line , a critical unknown is whether people would comply with a mandate on individuals to carry insurance , one of the Democrats ' primary tools to significantly increase the number of Americans who have coverage . The Senate Finance Committee , whose bill has dominated much of the recent debate , set its maximum penalty for noncompliance at $ 750 per year , at the same time creating subsidies to help low-income Americans buy coverage . In the House , the penalty is based on income , but works out to about the same for a middle-class family . As the behavioral economists see it , compliance will depend not only on the penalties and cost of coverage , but also on the ease of signing up for coverage and whether people can be persuaded that it is a widely accepted social norm . They point to the large number of eligible people who fail to take advantage of Medicaid , food stamps and Pell grants as a sign that perceived inconvenience can keep people from taking steps in their economic interest . By contrast , the Medicare drug benefit program has achieved high enrollment partly because low-income Medicare recipients did not need to apply for subsidies if they already qualified for Medicaid . '' Non-financial things matter. . . . When the choice itself is complicated , it can deter people from making choices , `` said William J. Congdon of the Brookings Institution . '' The small hassles associated with taking up programs -- driving to an office , filling out a form -- have a disproportionate effect in discouraging people. `` The record of mandates is mixed , according to research done by Sherry Glied , a Columbia University professor of health policy who has been nominated for a position in the administration . The rates of people buying car insurance , for example , vary among states and do not correlate directly with the size of penalties for going without insurance . Overall , she found , mandates work best when compliance is relatively easy and affordable , when penalties are `` stiff but not excessive , `` and when enforcement is prompt and routine . The thinking is that people tend to settle for the default option -- in the most oft-cited example , people are far more likely to participate in a 401 ( k ) savings plan at work if they are automatically enrolled in it , with the choice of opting out . OMB Director Peter Orszag has done research on that point , and Cass R. Sunstein , the director of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs , featured it in `` Nudge , `` the 2008 popularization of behavioral theory that he co-authored . Some experts argue against setting up an equivalent default enrollment for health insurance , since it would require spending money and choosing an insurer . But others , including one of the behavioral economists hired by Orszag , Harvard University 's Sendhil Mullainathan , have argued for using the tax system to collect automatic payments for health premiums . washingtonpost.com""","""So much for choice .

Men committed indecent acts with other men , and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion . 32 Although they know God 's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death , they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them . Now all one must do to rationally determine that God , through His word condemns the concept of homosexual marriage is to look at his attitude on homosexuality .

What about of the rights of these women who have been called to pioneer the new frontiers of the new millennium only to have their lives snuffed out before the calendar even turns ? Oh , God , what would Martin Luther King , Jr. , who dreamed of having his children judged by the content of their characters do if heÂ ’ d lived to see the contents of thousands of childrenÂ ’ s skulls emptied into the bottomless caverns of the abortionists pits ? It is time for America , perhaps the most blessed nation on earth to lead the world in repentance , and in restoration of life ! If only we can carry the freedom of repentance to its fullest potential . If only America can repent and turn away from the sins of our nation . Abortion is at the forefront of our destruction . Partial Birth Abortion is perhaps the most heinous form of this legal genocide . Direct links connecting abortion and serious conditions such as breast and cervical cancer , emotional disorders and other serious ills must be considered ! The only healing and redemption is in the blood of Jesus , blood willingly shed so that we could stand today and cry out for the blood of the unborn that is drenching the land of our children . What terribly mixed signals we are sending to our society today ? We allow and even encourage them to engage in promiscuous sex . Then when their sin conceives , we pretty much tell them , `` donÂ ’ t kill your babies , let our abortion facilities do it for you. `` We march to cure breast cancer , yet promote one of the biggest contributors . I am a mother of six living children , and I am a grandmother . I am also a post-abortive mother . In the early 1970Â ’ s , I suffered one involuntary and one voluntary abortion . My involuntary abortion was performed just prior to Roe v. Wade by my private physician without my consent . I had gone to the doctor to ask why my cycle had not resumed after the birth of my son . I did not ask for and did not want an abortion . The doctor said , Â “ You donÂ ’ t need to be pregnant , letÂ ’ s see.Â ” He proceeded to perform a painful examination which resulted in a gush of blood and tissue emanating from my womb . He explained that he had performed a Â “ local D and C.Â ” Soon after the Roe v. Wade decision , I became pregnant again . There was adverse pressure and threat of violence from the babyÂ ’ s father . The ease and convenience provided through Roe v. Wade made it too easy for me to make the fateful and fatal decision to abort our child . I went to a doctor and was advised that the procedure would hurt no more than Â “ having a tooth removed.Â ” The next day , I was admitted to the hospital , and our baby was aborted . My medical insurance paid for the procedure . As soon as I woke up , I knew that something was very wrong . I felt very ill , and very empty . I tried to talk to the doctor and nurses about it . They assured me that Â “ it will all go away in a few days . You will be fine.Â ” They lied . Over the next few years , I experienced medical problems . I had trouble bonding with my son , and his five siblings who were born after the abortions . I began to suffer from eating disorders , depression , nightmares , sexual dysfunctions and a host of other issues related to the abortion that I chose to have . I felt angry about both abortions , and very guilty about the abortion I chose to have . The guilt made me very ill. My children have all suffered from knowing that they have a brother or sister that their mother chose to abort . Often they ask if I ever thought about aborting them and have said , Â “ You killed our baby.Â ” This is very painful for all of us . Also , my mother and grandparents were very sad to know about the loss of the baby . The aborted childÂ ’ s father also regrets the abortion . If it had not been for Roe v. Wade , I would never have had that abortion , only Jesus can . My birthday is January 22 , and each year , this day is marred by the fact that it is the anniversary of Roe v. Wade , and the anniversary of death for millions of babies . I and my deceased children are victims of abortion , and subsequently the Roe v. Wade decision has adversely affected the lives of my entire family . I pray often for deliverance from the pain caused by my decision to abort my baby . I suffered the threat of cervical and breast cancer , and experienced the pain of empty arms after the baby was gone . And truly , for me , and countless abortive mothers , nothing on earth can fully restore what has been lost , only Jesus can . My grandfather , Dr. Martin Luther King , Sr. , once said , Â “ No one is going to kill a child of mine.Â ” Tragically , two of his grandchildren had already been aborted when he saved the life of his next great-grandson with this statement . His son , King once said , Â “ The Negro can not win as long as he is willing to sacrifice the lives of his children for comfort and safety.Â ” How can the Â “ DreamÂ ” survive if we murder the children ? Every aborted baby is like a slave in the womb of his or her mother . The mother decides his or her fate . I join the voices of thousands across America , who are SILENT NO MORE . We can no longer sit idly by and allow this horrible spirit of murder to cut down , yes cut out and cut away our unborn , and destroy the lives of our mothers . I am very grateful to God for the Spirit of Repentance that is sweeping our land . In Repentance there is healing . In the name of Jesus , we must humble ourselves and pray , and turn from our wicked ways , then God will hear from Heaven and Heal Our Land . I can only beseech the powers that be to hearken to the voice of the Lord and remember that human life is sacred . By taking the lives of our young , and wounding the wombs and lives of their mothers , we are flying in the face of God . We can not play God . If we continue down this path of destruction , we will be met at the gates by our own doom . This is the day to choose life . We must live and allow our babies to live . We must end the pain of post-abortion trauma . If the Dream of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. is to live , our babies must live . Our mothers must choose life . If we refuse to answer the cry of mercy from the unborn , and ignore the suffering of the mothers , then we are signing our own death warrants . I too , like Martin Luther King , Jr. , have a dream . I have a dream that the men and women , the boys and girls of America will come to our senses , and humble ourselves before God Almighty and pray for mercy , and receive His healing grace . I pray that this is the day , the hour of our deliverance . May God have mercy on us all .

What terribly mixed signals we are sending to our society today ? We allow and even encourage them to engage in promiscuous sex . Then when their sin conceives , we pretty much tell them , `` donÂ ’ t kill your babies , let our abortion facilities do it for you. `` We march to cure breast cancer , yet promote one of the biggest contributors . I am a mother of six living children , and I am a grandmother . I am also a post-abortive mother . In the early 1970Â ’ s , I suffered one involuntary and one voluntary abortion . My involuntary abortion was performed just prior to Roe v. Wade by my private physician without my consent . I had gone to the doctor to ask why my cycle had not resumed after the birth of my son . I did not ask for and did not want an abortion . The doctor said , Â “ You donÂ ’ t need to be pregnant , letÂ ’ s see.Â ” He proceeded to perform a painful examination which resulted in a gush of blood and tissue emanating from my womb . He explained that he had performed a Â “ local D and C.Â ” Soon after the Roe v. Wade decision , I became pregnant again . There was adverse pressure and threat of violence from the babyÂ ’ s father . The ease and convenience provided through Roe v. Wade made it too easy for me to make the fateful and fatal decision to abort our child . I went to a doctor and was advised that the procedure would hurt no more than Â “ having a tooth removed.Â ” The next day , I was admitted to the hospital , and our baby was aborted . My medical insurance paid for the procedure . As soon as I woke up , I knew that something was very wrong . I felt very ill , and very empty . I tried to talk to the doctor and nurses about it . They assured me that Â “ it will all go away in a few days . You will be fine.Â ” They lied . Over the next few years , I experienced medical problems . I had trouble bonding with my son , and his five siblings who were born after the abortions . I began to suffer from eating disorders , depression , nightmares , sexual dysfunctions and a host of other issues related to the abortion that I chose to have . I felt angry about both abortions , and very guilty about the abortion I chose to have . The guilt made me very ill. My children have all suffered from knowing that they have a brother or sister that their mother chose to abort . Often they ask if I ever thought about aborting them and have said , Â “ You killed our baby.Â ” This is very painful for all of us . Also , my mother and grandparents were very sad to know about the loss of the baby . The aborted childÂ ’ s father also regrets the abortion . If it had not been for Roe v. Wade , I would never have had that abortion , only Jesus can . My birthday is January 22 , and each year , this day is marred by the fact that it is the anniversary of Roe v. Wade , and the anniversary of death for millions of babies . I and my deceased children are victims of abortion , and subsequently the Roe v. Wade decision has adversely affected the lives of my entire family . I pray often for deliverance from the pain caused by my decision to abort my baby . I suffered the threat of cervical and breast cancer , and experienced the pain of empty arms after the baby was gone . And truly , for me , and countless abortive mothers , nothing on earth can fully restore what has been lost , only Jesus can . My grandfather , Dr. Martin Luther King , Sr. , once said , Â “ No one is going to kill a child of mine.Â ” Tragically , two of his grandchildren had already been aborted when he saved the life of his next great-grandson with this statement . His son , King once said , Â “ The Negro can not win as long as he is willing to sacrifice the lives of his children for comfort and safety.Â ” How can the Â “ DreamÂ ” survive if we murder the children ? Every aborted baby is like a slave in the womb of his or her mother . The mother decides his or her fate . I join the voices of thousands across America , who are SILENT NO MORE . We can no longer sit idly by and allow this horrible spirit of murder to cut down , yes cut out and cut away our unborn , and destroy the lives of our mothers . I am very grateful to God for the Spirit of Repentance that is sweeping our land . In Repentance there is healing . In the name of Jesus , we must humble ourselves and pray , and turn from our wicked ways , then God will hear from Heaven and Heal Our Land . I can only beseech the powers that be to hearken to the voice of the Lord and remember that human life is sacred . By taking the lives of our young , and wounding the wombs and lives of their mothers , we are flying in the face of God . We can not play God . If we continue down this path of destruction , we will be met at the gates by our own doom . This is the day to choose life . We must live and allow our babies to live . We must end the pain of post-abortion trauma . If the Dream of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. is to live , our babies must live . Our mothers must choose life . If we refuse to answer the cry of mercy from the unborn , and ignore the suffering of the mothers , then we are signing our own death warrants . I too , like Martin Luther King , Jr. , have a dream . I have a dream that the men and women , the boys and girls of America will come to our senses , and humble ourselves before God Almighty and pray for mercy , and receive His healing grace . I pray that this is the day , the hour of our deliverance . May God have mercy on us all .

King founded King for America , Inc. `` to assist people in enriching their lives spiritually , personally , mentally and economically. `` She is the daughter of the late slain civil rights activist Rev . A. D. King and his wife Naomi Barber King . Alveda is the grateful mother of eight children and she is a doting grandmother . During the more than half century of her life , Alveda has worked towards her purpose of glorifying God in the earth by accomplishing many goals . Currently , Alveda is a minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ , serving as Director of African American Outreach for Gospel of Life , headed up by Father Frank Pavone of Priests for Life . She also consults with the Africa Humanitarian Christian Fellowship , founded by her mentor , Pastor Allen McNair of Believers ' Bible Christian Church in Atlanta , Georgia . She is a former college professor , holding the Masters of Arts degree in Business Management from Central Michigan University . Her undergraduate studies in journalism and sociology helped her to become a published author , the most popular works being her best selling books SONS OF THUNDER : THE KING FAMILY LEGACY , and I DO N'T WANT YOUR MAN , I WANT MY OWN . This inspirational collection of Christian testimonies is used at conferences and workshops around the world . Alveda 's Doctorate of Laws was conferred by Saint Anslem College . She has served as a Senior Fellow of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institute .

She also served in the Georgia State House of Representatives , and is an accomplished actress and songwriter . During the years of the Civil Rights Movement , led by her Uncle , Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , Alveda 's family home was bombed in Birmingham , Alabama . In the heat of the struggle . '' Daddy 's house was bombed , then in Louisville , Kentucky his church office was bombed . I was also jailed during the open housing movement , `` she recalls . Alveda has continued her long-term work as a civil rights activist , speaking out on issues that face society today . '' I believe that School Choice is a pressing civil rights issue . Perhaps the most compelling issue of all is the life of the unborn , `` Alveda says . '' Faith in God , and the commitment to fulfill His will for our lives -- not faith in government bureaucracy - is the key to positive action . Have faith in God ! `` This is the message that Alveda carries to the world .""","""You know something is wrong with this world when people start calling embryos and non-sentient life forms victims and referring to martin Luther King Jr. to justify their views .

'' Lott now admits he used a fake persona , 'Mary Rosh , ' to post voluminous defenses of his work over the Internet . 'Rosh ' gushed that Lott was 'the best professor that I ever had . ' She/he also penned an effusive review of 'More Guns , Less Crime ' on Amazon.com : `` It was very interesting reading and Lott writes very well. `` ( Lott claims that one of his sons posted the review in 'Rosh 's ' name . ) Just last week , 'Rosh ' complained on a blog comment board : `` Critics such as Lambert and Lindgren ought to slink away and hide. `` '' By itself , there is nothing wrong with using a pseudonym . But Lott 's invention of Mary Rosh to praise his own research and blast other scholars is beyond creepy .

According to your logic , this would mean he was a drunk driver because he was a liquor store owner , therefore , all liquor store owners are drunk drivers . But according to my logic , instead of focusing on a mere `` feel good `` bit of information , I would look at the actual drunk driving records of liquor store owners . What if I found out that this was the only incident of a liquor store owner killing someone in the past 50 years ? Which is closer to the truth : Your assertion that liquor store owners are all dangerous because of this one incident , or mine that they are n't because of the actual facts ? The state of Virginia has no requirement for a CCW permit . CCW permits are available for request for those citizens who desire documentation in order to carry in other states .

( We know at least 225,000 are carrying there because they have requested one ) ..... let 's be conservative and say that half of them have done so . This means that over 50 % of gun carriers enjoy paperwork . My guess would be less than half desire documentation , but hey , I 'm gon na be conservative . So , over 500,000 people carrying CCW in Virginia everyday and one of them goes nuts . This means that CCW holders account for less than 1/10th of 1 percent of shootings in Virginia .

Secondly be careful in the use of the term creationist- remember AiG are Young Earth Creationists and do not speak for creationists as a whole- there are Christians who accept the analysis of science yet still see the universe as the creation of God ( ie . Old Earth Creationists ) . This is significant as it is important to drive the point home that YEC does not speak on behalf of all Christians ( as it likes to make out ) , but are a group on the fringe whose position is seen as ridiculous by Christian and non-Christian alike . Put this to them and you force them to start attacking fellow Christians . P.S . Welcome to the Forum !""",AGREE,"""Whats the best way to go up against creationists bastards seeking the brainwash the populace ?""","""Young Earth Creationists and do not speak for creationists as a"""
