1711,"""Of course I believe an unborn fetus is simply an unborn child . The only difference is that the unborn has no means of survival without the mother and is not recognized as being a living person . I do n't wish that this child should be killed , but as I said before it can be for the best . And if you really do believe in heaven , then the child is going there anyways . Why would you wish a life of suffering on it instead of being able to skip all that and go straight to heaven ? This is the type of logic that works against those who believe in a soul since it really does n't make much sense to live on Earth when heaven is a million billion times better . Just to answer your question with a question , how do you know a child would choose life over death when it has never lived ? People commit suicide everyday but I 'm sure they would also choose life over death if they had been in a better situation . Perhaps this is being too extreme .

WARD : Well , Let 's talk about the information that you have . FLYNT : Well , we 've been doing an investigation for a little over eight months to the effect that an abortion took place in 1970 in Houston , Texas . He was working for his father 's campaign when he was running for the senate against Lloyd Bentsen , and a fellow by the name of Robert Chandler was the campaign manager . He got a girl pregnant during this period of time , and she had an abortion . We've been able to locate the doctor who performed the procedure ( unintelligible ) hospital in Houston . Not only that but we have the affidavits from four of her friends stating that they knew about the affair , the pregnancy and the subsequent abortion . The only thing we could not have which we needed to break the story was the girl to come out , and she would not come out . Whether she was afraid or whether she was paid off , I do n't really want to speculate , because I do n't know what the actual reason was . But when I started taking this to the mainstream media , I said you do n't have to break the story , just ask the question , you know . You asked the cocaine question , so just ask if he's ever facilitated an abortion or paid for an abortion or if he was the father of a child . Just give him the chance to admit or deny it . No one would touch it . WARD : As of now , the woman who you know denies that she had the abortion ? FLYNT : No , no , no . She does n't deny that . We know she had the abortion . We know she was Bush's girlfriend at the time . This was in the 1970 's , he would have been in his twenties at the time . But she does not want to come out . The last conversation my investigators had with her , she said I do n't have anything bad to say about George W. And they said , well , how about when he did not come to visit you in the hospital when you had the abortion , didn't that upset you ? So she got very upset and irate because I took that line of questioning , and said , you know , I am not going to talk to you anymore about this issue .

WARD : Were abortions legal in Texas at this time ? FLYNT : No , that was before Roe versus Wade and that makes it a crime .

Of course , he admitted he's been a drunk for twenty years and so that coupled with the additional information that we have , you know , would just be devastating to him . WARD : Well , Let 's talk about the information that you have . FLYNT : Well , we 've been doing an investigation for a little over eight months to the effect that an abortion took place in 1970 in Houston , Texas . He was working for his father 's campaign when he was running for the senate against Lloyd Bentsen , and a fellow by the name of Robert Chandler was the campaign manager . He got a girl pregnant during this period of time , and she had an abortion . We've been able to locate the doctor who performed the procedure ( unintelligible ) hospital in Houston . Not only that but we have the affidavits from four of her friends stating that they knew about the affair , the pregnancy and the subsequent abortion . The only thing we could not have which we needed to break the story was the girl to come out , and she would not come out . Whether she was afraid or whether she was paid off , I do n't really want to speculate , because I do n't know what the actual reason was . But when I started taking this to the mainstream media , I said you do n't have to break the story , just ask the question , you know . You asked the cocaine question , so just ask if he's ever facilitated an abortion or paid for an abortion or if he was the father of a child . Just give him the chance to admit or deny it . No one would touch it . WARD : As of now , the woman who you know denies that she had the abortion ? FLYNT : No , no , no . She does n't deny that . We know she had the abortion . We know she was Bush's girlfriend at the time . This was in the 1970 's , he would have been in his twenties at the time . But she does not want to come out . The last conversation my investigators had with her , she said I do n't have anything bad to say about George W. And they said , well , how about when he did not come to visit you in the hospital when you had the abortion , didn't that upset you ? So she got very upset and irate because I took that line of questioning , and said , you know , I am not going to talk to you anymore about this issue . WARD : But when your investigators talked to this woman , did she ever say to them that you guys are wrong , I never had the abortion . FLYNT : No . No . WARD : And in these affidavits , I assume you have copies of the affidavits , you have affidavits from four of her friends saying that they know she had the abortion ? FLYNT : Yes , and we have this guy , Robert Chandler , who I said was George Bush 's campaign manager at the time , his girlfriend is one of our key sources on this story who actually accompanied the girl who had the abortion to the hospital .

5313,"""March 25 , 2004 Washington , DC - Planned Parenthood Federation of America ( PPFA ) today denounced the Senate 's passage of S. 1019 , the so-called Unborn Victims of Violence Act ( UVVA ) , which creates a penalty for anyone convicted of harming a fetus during commission of certain federal crimes . The UVVA would give separate legal status to a fertilized egg , embryo , or fetus even if the woman does not know she is pregnant . '' The so-called Unborn Victims of Violence Act ( UVVA ) is not intended to protect pregnant women from domestic violence or punish individuals who harm them , `` said PPFA President Gloria Feldt . '' It is part of a deceptive anti-choice strategy to make women 's bodies mere vessels by creating legal personhood for the fetus. `` The UVVA was created with the sole aim of undermining the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision , in which the Supreme Court ruled that `` the word 'person ' as used in the Fourteenth Amendment , does not include the unborn. `` This bill elevates the legal status of a fetus to make it equal to that of the adult woman who actually suffers the primary injury . It is part of ongoing attempts to bestow personhood on the fetus by granting it separate legal rights equal to and independent of those of the pregnant woman . This legislation , which passed the Senate 61 to 38 , fails to mention the harm to the woman resulting from an involuntary termination of her pregnancy . Sponsors of the UVVA today made their ideological goal abundantly clear : when given the opportunity to vote for a substitute bill that had virtually identical criminal penalties but recognized the pregnant woman , rather than the fetus , as the victim , they voted against the alternative . '' Violence against women , including pregnant women , is a significant problem in America , one that should be addressed , `` stated Feldt . '' This bill does nothing but shift the focus away from real solutions by undermining women's health and reproductive freedoms. `` Because the UVVA is a Federal Bill , it can not actually be used in any murder case , which would fall under State Law . This would make the UVVA ineffectual in actually protecting a pregnant woman , but create a stepping stone for a national ban on abortion . An alternate version of the bill , which recognizes the pregnant woman as the victim , and includes a provision to the Tenth Amendment ( States Rights ) , was voted against by the same people who voted for the UVVA .""","""That is fairly rediculous .

5448,"""Honestly Duck would you base your views off a 74 year old with parkinson 's if he were n't the pope . The bible is pretty much silent on abortion ( if anything it says life starts at birth with the first breath ) , and the current pope 's record is hardly without blemishes . Why could n't this be a little different that the official line ?""","""To step in for Duck , Why would he follow a 74 year old with parkinson 's if he were n't the pope ? We would n't . The whole point is that he is the pope . We look to the pope to be the messenger of Christ and thus an authority on faith and morals . ( By the way he 's 84 years old and I think he gives a powerful message about the value of life and purpose in the elderly . ) So we do n't just follow any 74 year old with parkinson 's . We follow the one who is the 264th successor of Peter who was appointed by Christ to lead his Church . But to address your assertion on the bible and abortion : Nowhere in the Bible is abortion specifically prohibited but the foundation of Christian argument from a biblical perspective is the fact that the unborn being is established as a person from the moment of creation . The unborn being is considered a child . Thus the commandment , `` Thou shalt not kill `` applies .

5450,"""To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous .""","""Well not to the pro-life league . Remember the Unborn Victims of Violence Act passed by the senate after laci peterson ? or as they call it , conners law ? The UVVA creates a federal law making it a crime to cause harm to a `` child in utero , `` recognizing everything from a zygote to a fetus as an independent `` victim , `` with legal rights distinct from the woman who has been attacked . '' More than 30 states already have similar laws on the books . In practice , these laws treat the pregnant woman as little more than collateral damage in an attack portrayed to the public as one directed against the fetus. `` See , this law has nothing to do with prosecuting criminals who attack pregnant woman , it is about turning pregnant women into criminals . Why do i say that ? Lynn M. Paltrow , executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women sums it up quite well : * In 1984 , South Carolina 's Supreme Court created a state feticide law in a case where a man viciously stabbed his pregnant girlfriend , causing her , among other things , to lose her pregnancy . In 1997 , South Carolina used this law against a pregnant woman , Cornelia Whitner , who was charged with failing `` to provide proper medical care for her unborn child. `` Whitner had given birth to a healthy baby who tested positive for an illegal drug . Based on extrapolation of the state feticide law , Ms. Whitner was convicted of criminal child abuse . At sentencing Ms. Whitner begged for drug treatment . The judge responded , `` I think I 'll just let her go to jail. `` * Regina McKnight was an indigent 22-year-old woman with a drug problem . She became pregnant and despite her problems had every hope of carrying her pregnancy to term , but the pregnancy ended in stillbirth . The hospital reacted not by offering her counseling or drug treatment , but rather by helping build a criminal case against her . Eventually she was convicted of murder . The South Carolina Medical Association and other leading health groups concluded that there was no evidence that McKnight 's drug use caused the stillbirth . Moreover , no one in this case , not even the prosecution , believed that McKnight had any intention of harming the fetus or losing the pregnancy . Had McKnight intentionally sought to end her pregnancy by having an illegal third trimester abortion , her sentence would have been two years in jail -- but because of a law similar to the bill President Bush just signed , she is today serving a 12-year sentence . read more here another good article on the matter : Do pregnant woman have rights ? * In 1984 , for example , a Nigerian woman pregnant and hospitalized in Chicago was forced to have a C-section . She refused the surgery because she planned to return to Nigeria where she would be unable to access C-sections for future births . The hospital obtained a court order and forced her to undergo the procedure . Hospital staff tied her down with leather wrist and ankle cuffs while she screamed for help . * Another hospital obtained a court order to force a pregnant woman to undergo a blood transfusion . Doctors `` yelled at and forcibly restrained , overpowered and sedated `` the woman in order to carry out the order . * In Washington , DC , doctors sought a court order to force Ayesha Madyun to have a C-section . The doctors asserted that the fetus faced a 50-75 percent chance of infection if not delivered surgically . The court , apparently viewing the pregnant woman as having no more rights than a slab of meat , said , `` [ a ] ll that stood between the Madyun fetus and its independent existence , separate from its mother , was put simply , a doctor 's scalpel. `` With that , the court granted the order and the scalpel sliced through Ms. Madyun 's flesh , the muscles of her abdominal wall , and her uterus . When the procedure was done , there was no evidence of infection . * Angela Carder at 27 years old and 25 weeks pregnant became critically ill. She , her family and her attending physicians all agreed on treatment designed to keep her alive for as long as possible . The hospital however called an emergency hearing to determine the rights of the fetus . Despite testimony that a Cesarean section could kill Ms. Carder , the court ordered the surgery because the fetus had independent legal rights . As a result , Ms. Carder not only lost her right to informed consent and bodily integrity ; she lost her life . The surgery resulted in the death of both Angela and her fetus . '' All of these women were denied the right to bodily integrity and physical liberty and their fetuses were granted more rights than any legal person under law. `` That line just about sums it up . These laws are n't about saving the unborn , and neither is the pro-life movement . It is about controlling and punishing pregnant woman . It is about taking rights away from the woman the moment of conception .. as if she no longer exists . These people would not think twice about prosecuting a pregnant woman whos pregnancy results in misscarriage ... intentional , accidental , whatever .""",DISAGREE,"""equate miscarriage with manslaughter""","""prosecuting would not think twice woman whos pregnancy results in misscarriage"""

5915,"""Simply put , the majority of Christian teaching today differs a lot from when Jesus started it . In fact , I 'd go as far as saying that the majority of so-called `` Christians `` today are an insult to Jesus . Jesus used the bible when speaking to his people and he condoned it . Therefore , as Christians you have to follow ALL the bible . Not just pick and choose which bits you like . Christendom today gives true Christians a bad name , it is false worship . Take a look at these examples of `` Christians `` that go against what the bible teaches : The Roman Catholic Church permits the worship of Jesus ' mother marry . This tradition has PAGAN origin ( http : //bupc.montana.com/whores/marywors.html ) and was not part of the Christian faith . Even worse , the bible condemns any worship that is n't directed at God - Deuteronomy 5:9 ; 6:13 ( Jesus himself refered to this scripture when the devil was trying to temp him ) . One of the ten commandments strictly forbids worshipping anything other than God ( Idolatry ) . Plenty religions permit idolatry , which is a great defiance of God 's word - Â “ You must not have any other gods against my face .

5925,"""Licensing systems are very expensive to administer . Canada 's experience with its full licensing and registration system , begun in December 1998 , is not encouraging . The government originally estimated that the cost of licensing Canada 's three million gun owners and registering their seven million guns would be $ 185 million [ Canadian ] over five years including a one-time start-up cost of $ 85 million [ Canadian ] . But , by March 2000 the Canadian Firearms Centre admitted that the system had already cost Canadian taxpayers $ 327 million [ Canadian ] and was running up an annual bill nearly 10 times higher than the government 's original forecast . The March announcement also revealed that although 270,000 valid licenses existed from the country 's earlier gun control system , only 142,000 new licenses had been issued . Using these figures as a baseline for America 's arsenal of 65 million handguns , the estimated cost of such a system here is staggering . Most importantly , licensing and registration in America would have little effect on the vast majority of gun violence , such as unintentional gunshot deaths , suicides and the majority of homicides , since most homicides are the result of arguments between people who know each other and who purchase guns legally . From a political perspective , a battle over licensing and registration brings every gun owner into the fray . The NRA argument that licensing and registration is the first step towards gun confiscation has always been very persuasive with gun owners . In contrast , health and safety regulation of the industry focuses on the conduct of firearm manufacturers . Advocates of licensing and registration often cite automobiles as an example of the value of licensing and registration : we register automobiles and license drivers , so why not guns ? However , licensing and registrationÂ—the primary purpose of which was to enforce a system of taxationÂ—had virtually no effect on automobile death and injury .

'' Ezekiel predicted Babylon would conquer Egypt and was wrong ``""","""Hey , bring it on . A month ago , I read over your 'failed prophecies ' and if you are ready to listen , there is no problem explaining what happened with Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt . It is mature fare and hard for even Christians to accept sometimes , but the long and short of it is this : you do n't even begin to know the God you are dealing with . If you give me a space of time to get things together , I can introduce you to a being who is so much like you that you will almost be fooled into feeling that you 're his `` buddy `` then I will introduce you to the same being who can tear you to pieces if he chooses ( Ps . 50 ) Here 's a hint though about what happened in Egypt : God changed his mind . But you did n't know he could do that ? You would be surprised how much like you he really is . He changed his mind several times in the text of the Bible : Abraham tried to get Him to but could n't get Him to stop his destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , God was out to kill Moses ' sons , but Moses quickly circumcised them and God changed his mind , also Moses succeeded in changing God 's mind when Moses learned that He was out to destroy the Israelites , God was determined to level Ninevah but after Jonah preached He changed his mind because the people repented , God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah saying : When I pronounce judgment on a peoples but they later turn from their sins , I will change my mind concerning the judgment I had determined on them . But be careful - when He is set on doing something , it gets done . Just when you think you have a `` pal `` in God , he says something like this to the prophet Ezekiel : when a land sins against Me , though Noah and Daniel and Job are in it , they will deliver but their own souls . Even righteous Noah could n't stay the hand of the Almighty when He was dead set on destroying the first world . Real quick : one of the major ways God judges a people group is via another wicked people or wicked king . Happens time and time again in scripture . Do n't have time to elaborate right now . Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked king and in God 's hand he was simply a pawn to use to punish other nations . So while God is using him to punish Egypt , He is punishing Nebuchadnezzar and his nation as well . Get it ? Is it too mature for you ? Do n't believe it ? Too bad .... it 's true . God will bring a nation to full dominance and power in order to punish other nations . When He is through using them , He will often turn His wrath on the punishing nation who was His original `` servant `` so to speak . This is mature teaching . Most Christians do n't like it . Too bad .... it 's true . You do n't even begin to understand the God you are dealing with and the One you are rebelling against and the One you are defying day by day . One day , He will be finished with you as well . Psalms gives your day of prophecy like this ( God is speaking ) : All these things you have done and I kept silent . You thought I was altogether like you , but I will come and and rebuke you and tear you to pieces . Ps 50:21 Know what happened with your 'failed prophecy ? ' God changed His mind !

I too had my doubts about the veracity of the global warming claims at every level of the propaganda they have spewed from so many different sources , for so long . And those very sources have been exposed as participants in this scam now , which just makes my decade ... Here 's a link to a link I posted in the debate about the scam of carbon credits right here on 4forums back in January of 08 , and an excerpt from that article . Read some of the defenders posts and look at the sources they rely on to justify the global warming scam . It 's absolutely incredible how they just lap up the lies and follow the propaganda like lambs to the slaughter . Will Media Report Global Warming 'Carbon Credit ' Fraud ? By Noel Sheppard ( Bio | Archive ) April 25 , 2007 - 21:54 ET ItÂ ’ s conceivable that years from now , AmericaÂ ’ s media will be reporting one of the biggest frauds in history : the idea that a wealthy person , for instance , soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore , can purchase Â “ carbon creditsÂ ” to offset his lavish lifestyle making him quote Â “ carbon neutral.Â ” Given the mediaÂ ’ s love affair with the former vice president as well as advancing man-made global warming hysteria , few American press members have dared to expose this hoax for what it is . However , on Wednesday , an impeccably reputable publication , the Financial Times , published an article that is a deliciously inconvenient truth for folks like Gore , Laurie David , Sheryl Crow , and all the rest of the alarmists that are actively involved in what years from now will be considered one of the biggest scams ever ( emphasis added throughout ) : http : //www.4forums.com/political/297828-post25.html""",AGREE,"""I called that one back in 2005 when I debated Clive14 on AGW .""","""Great insight to him ."""

The creature , called the Flying Spaghetti Monster , is the creation of Bobby Henderson of Corvallis , Ore . It looks like a clump of spaghetti with two eyes sticking out of the top and two meatballs flanking the eyes . Henderson created the entity and an accompanying mythology on the origin of mankind to make fun of Kansas ' recent debate over the teaching of criticisms of evolution , including intelligent design .

She did not return phone calls for this report . Gamble , who voted against the new standards and was also on the tour , said that Morris asked principal Kenneth Jantz to have the picture taken down .

7800,"""How did a lizard evolve an avian lung ?""","""Well , the easy answer is that a lizard did n't evolve an avian lung . There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung . However , there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles , including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians . And I am sure that peddler is aware that the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds , having arisen from an ancestral archosaur . The dinosaurs , through the ornithodirans , also arose from archosaurs . So the more advanced lung structure may have been ancestral since lizards arose from ancestral diapsids which also gave rise to the archosaurs . So some birds have a system of ( usually ) 9 flexible air sacs that that act as bellows to move air through the lungs . Although the air sacs are not directly involved in respiration , they do have other functions , such as thermoregulation and weight reduction . Extensions of these air sacs have invaded the skeleton and form what are called pneumatic bones in birds . However , there is considerable evidence that this condition occurred in organisms ancestral to birds first . Thus , in the maniraptoriformes it may have been useful in weight reduction in running predators and was retained in birds because the weight reduction was also useful for flight . But some birds , current and fossil , do not have pneumatic bones . For example , Hesperonis lacked them for obvious reasons . But of course , Hesperonis lacked wings useful for flight . Looks like peddler is just a parrot of what his controlers have told him to say . To bad he lacks the integrity to educate himself .""",DISAGREE,"""How did a lizard evolve an avian lung""","""There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung However , there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles , including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians ."""

I also have many gay friends outside of these organizations . I know of none being sexually promiscuous , though perhaps some are doing it behind my back . I know of many who do believe that sex is for pleasure , but an equal , if not greater percentage of heterosexuals who also believe sex should be used for pleasure . Further , I know a number of very promiscuous heterosexuals . Yet we let those heterosexuals marry . In truth , I see no reason not to . Lots of people of all sexual orientations believe that sex should be used for pleasure , not just children . This fact is a religious / moral belief , and it does not make these people bad parents , nor does it make these people bad people , nor does it make these people less in need of the benefits of marriage should they decide to start a family . If we are going to give marriage to some people , it is inexcusable to deny that marriage to others who are in equal need of it . If you would like others to respect your status as a husband ( or wife , or whatever you would prefer that I refer to you as ) , then you must be willing to respect the marriage of others in return .""",DISAGREE,"""claiming to be 'just like me ' detracts from that argument , ! sex is for pleasure , and if you 're trying to avoid having kids the best way is to * * * * the same sex as yourself !
