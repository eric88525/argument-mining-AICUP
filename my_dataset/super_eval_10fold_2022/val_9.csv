Waxy enters a debate on Science/Math says that I 've been refuted somewhere else , by someone else , and then leaves ; does the same thing on these Creation/Evolution debates ... only adds a few insults in the process ... not wishing to debate , just to name call . Mach is happy to admit he does n't read my posts/skims over them but wants to both debate and not debate them - claiming he 's got a time problem ... and asks me to post stuff he 's already replied to Would you count as a word-game the two incidents where you 've made a claim about me being insulting , and when I 've asked you to point it out , you ca n't ? One time you were so flustered you told me you were going to warn everyone about me . You make allegations then do n't back them up . Archilochus makes allegations that I do n't understand the word 'chance ' but is un-prepared to come up with a definition , just repeats that I do n't understand it . He 'll go on repeating this , because it is a replacement for debate . All the while you guys are very shy when it comes to debating each other 's mistakes ; such as Hank describing the world as egg-shaped , etc . In short you make so many 'just-so ' statements with little recourse to evidence , in an effort to drown out anyone who differs in opinion from yourself . Hence the total unwillingness to seriously tackle anyone from your own side who is either a ) wrong or b ) rude But in short , if someone posts here a statement , and they ca n't even be sure what they mean by it , then it does n't bode well . That is what has upset a number of people ; when this has been pointed out . This is also why many pro-evolutionists are so quick to resort to ad hominem here . That 's what this thread of yours is an attempt at - and at best it is something that suggests only other people are guilty of this crime .""","""No , I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause . Just for the record montalban , basically every single legitimate scientist is `` pro-evolution `` . Creation theory is not taught in public schools , not by chance , but because ... * gasp * it 's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO . There is no evidence to support it . Creation fiction has made no progress with it 's `` faith-based `` ( lackofevidence ) with rational people . And I 'll also say that I 'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day . Ad hominem is just a lack of patience , or someone who does n't care to hide their emotion or opinion . Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death . Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate .

I think if anyone took to this they 'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely . I 'm not against concealed carry in principle but open carry seems silly to me . I smell posers .""","""Open carry is gaining momentum in Michigan , so who knows ? And the I smell posers comment ... well , I 'll just say that I think you 're jumping to a premature conclusion . I 'm catching up on this thread and have a few more pages to go , but I wanted to address this comment before I go on . Most of us who openly carry in Michigan , are licensed to conceal , but we are carrying openly to promote the concept . Let me note that I , too , believe that openly carrying an unloaded firearm is asking for trouble . I ca n't see how it could make any situation safer , with it taking seconds to load a gun and get it into battery . Luckily we carry loaded here , which drastically changes the dynamics . When one can go from either concealment or a side holstered weapon to putting holes in a center mass in under a second , that 's an effective deterrent . Then we hear the `` gun grab `` argument - if you 're openly carrying , anyone could grab your gun . This just is n't practical . If a criminal wants a gun , h'es going to B & amp ; E a house or obtain it by other means than trying to take it off of someone who 's wearing one . There 's just too big a chance of getting shot . Not to mention that when someone is openly carrying , they generally have a heightened state of awareness . We pay more attention to what 's going on around us . Another hitch in that argument is equipment . Most who OC , like me , have retention holsters . They `` lock `` the gun into place in the holster and a button must be pressed to draw the weapon . Therefore , someone would n't be able to just sneak up and pull the weapon from its holster . Criminals traditionally go for easy targets . If Joe is visibly armed and Pete is n't , which would be the more likely victim ? If a thug walks into a C-store with ill intentions and sees a customer or two armed , I can say with certainty that the thug will wait until the store 's empty or pick another location . Carrying openly can be an effective crime deterrent , and seeing armed good guys here and there is a constant reminder to the criminal element that we ( , the People ) are taking arms and proactively defending ourselves . Just bear these things in mind before jumping on the `` open carry is crazy `` bandwagon .""",DISAGREE,"""I think if anyone took to this they 'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely .""","""I can say with certainty that the thug will wait until the store 's empty or pick another location .

I 'll start by saying that , as I understand it , death is certain and fossilization of the remains is highly uncommon . An animal or plant dies and immediately scavengers , animals plants and bacteria , start the process of reclaiming materials from the carcass . There is very little chance of any part of the organism to be left to fossilize . Unless the carcass was relatively quickly protected from scavenger organisms , there is hardly any chance it will form a fossil . So , maybe most fossils we see are the result of a tragic , untimely death . Is this evidence for the flood ?""","""Well by the Flood , I assume you are refering to the description given in Genesis ? Fossils we find today have been attributed to a remarkable variety of environmental settings that allowed them to be preserved . Also , you seem to be refering to the preservation of large animals such as terrestrial vertebrates , which are far rarer than fossils of marine organisms with calcarous skeletons . In that regard , some types of rock are basically one huge fossil as most of their composition is derived from dead animal material . There are just so many different types in which creatures are preserved it is not possible to consider the events within the context of a word like `` tragic `` Unusual ? sometimes . In some cases the word inevitable is the most apt . Also , there are quite a few numbers of ways in which animals have been preserved without the direct involvement of water/sedimentation- terrestrial invertebrates trapped in amber , tarpit `` traps `` like those of the famous Rancho la Brea with remarkable preservations of ice-age mammal fauna and mummified animals from desert environments ( off the top of my head ) . Plus then you have a whole set of fossils preserved in water conditions where there has been very slow , low energy deposition of sediments , like black shales and the Lithographic limestones of Solnhofen .""",DISAGREE,"""I decided to start a thread to see what folks had to say about fossilization .""","""Well by the Flood , I assume you are refering to the description given in Genesis ?"""

1367,"""The death toll from fierce street battles in downtown West Kingston has risen to 44 and is expected to climb further as Jamaican security forces continue efforts to flush out the alleged drugs baron Christopher `` Dudus `` Coke . The latest figures were released after a team led by the public defender Earl Witter and including the Jamaican Red Cross visited the Tivoli Gardens district , scene of the worst fighting . Witter told local media : `` The police , I gather , have put out a figure of some 26 dead so far . Our own headcount supersedes that . In fact we visited the morgue and were told that no fewer than 35 bodies were lodged there , and most of them were males , mainly young adults. `` While at the morgue his team was told of another nine bodies being collected , he said . At least 37 people are reported to have been injured and the government has appealed for blood donations . In addition 211 people including six women have been detained . The team was sent in by the Jamaican prime minister , Bruce Golding , following claims of abuse by police and soldiers who stormed the Tivoli Gardens ghetto on Monday in search of Coke , 42 , wanted on drug and gun-running charges in the US . He is still at large , with unconfirmed reports saying he slipped out of Tivoli Gardens on Monday while Jamaican soldiers were engaged in an intense firefight . Civilians have been the main victims during three days of street battles between security forces and gunmen loyal to Coke , the alleged leader of the notorious Shower Posse gang , who have erected barricades of barbed wire and junked cars . Soldiers have told local media of five-hour gun battles in the streets . A state of emergency has been declared in the West Kingston area , said to be Coke 's stronghold and where he is regarded as a benefactor by many people . The intensity of the fighting in the heart of the West Kingston slums , which is Golding 's own constituency , has taken the government by surprise , the prime minister has admitted . More than 2,000 soliders flooded into the neighbourhood after Jamaica agreed to extradite Coke to the US . Residents in the no-go area have complained of grenades being thrown by soldiers and of bodies being burned in the streets . Witter said they had seen no evidence of bodies being burned . Golding told MPs : `` The government deeply regrets the loss of lives , especially those of members of the security services and innocent , law-abiding citizens caught in the crossfire . '' The security forces were directed to take all practical steps to avoid casualties as much as possible. `` The `` most thorough investigations `` would be undertaken to examine all deaths caused by troops or police , he said . The country 's security forces have a reputation for slipshod investigations and being too quick on the trigger . Security agents would go after `` criminal gunmen in whatever community they may be ensconced `` , he said . Government officials told reporters all the dead civilians in West Kingston were men , but people inside the slums who called local radio stations claimed there had been indiscriminate shooting during the all-out assault by police and soldiers . Gunmen fighting for Coke describe him as a `` godfather `` figure who helps provide services and protection to the poor West Kingston community . The services and protection are allegedly funded by a criminal empire that seemed untouchable until the US demanded his extradition . Coke , also known as the President , has built a loyal following and turned the neighbourhood into his stronghold . One placard seen at a barricade read : `` Jesus died for us .

1643,"""How likely is that Kansas will succeed and also is the teaching of YEC likely to spread to other states ?""","""YEC really si n't an issue here . Here is a link to what everybody is up in arms about , the proposed chanegs to the KS BOE science standards : http : //www.kansasscience2005.com/Pro ... Sci % 20Stds.pdf They are not talking about actually teaching creationism in the classroom , nor is there actually any discussion about not teaching evolution . What they want is to write into state guidelines requirements that kids have to be told that there are other theories out there , and there are holes in the theory of evolution . Personally , I see no problem with this , and it has more or less been our unofficial policy for years around here . There are holes in the theory of evolution , and there are segments of it that are mostly conjecture . It is in no way as foolish as the YEC theory , or even the strict creationist theory , but there are certianly hole in the theory . We may fill them in the future , but for now , we just have conjecture to fill those holes . All they are really pressing for is basically for kids parents to tell their kids AT HOME that god guided evolution without it contrasting directly with what the kids are being taught at school . Personally , I see no problem with this , as long as they stick to the facts in any case . Just glanmcing over the proposed changes , I am not seeing anything that is factually incorrect . The problem is that you have wack jobs and zealots on both sides of the issue . On the one hand , you have the YEC/creationist crowd . Some fo them go off the deep end when you suggest anything but a literal interpetationof Genisis . On the other side , you have the evolutionaist crowd , who predict gloom and doom and a return to the middle ages every time you suggest that we leave some opening for kids parents to attach religous connotation to the issue . The evolutionist zealots are essentially pushig to remove any possible religous connotation from evolutionary teaching . The YEC folks want to remove any reference to science from the debate . Normal folks , people who are not just trying to * * * * on somebody elses religon or force their religon down somebody elses throat seem to be pushing for a secular and neutral classroom . This is not an unobtainable goal . In truth , we could put everything we absolutly know about evolution ( have physical proof for ) in a box , and it would be a small one . A large part of th theory is conjecture . Teach the kids what is conjecture and what is not . This just makes good sense . Teach it how it is , not how you wish it was . How many hundreds of years have we lost in scientific development because people failed to experiment into areas that were believed to be known ? How long idd the theory of spontaneus generation hold prevelance before somebody actually challenged it scientifically ? Nobody is suggesting that creationism be pushed in our classrooms . Nobody is even suggesitng that evolution NOT be taught . They are suggesting that evolution be taught acuratly . They want the kids to understand that the theory of evolution certainly has a wide body of evidence behind it , but it also has a substantial amount of conjecture tacked on . While most of the commonly held conjecture certainly fits the evidence at hand , there may be other explanations , explanations we have not even thought of yet , that also fit the evidence . One example is the section about the primordial soup theory . Do we actually have any evidence for the existance of `` primordial soup `` ? Have we found fossilized soup ? Have we ever managed to create such a soup in a lab ? Have we ever seen an example of life emerging from a sterile , lifeless environment ? Is there really a difference between this and the theory of spontaneus generation ? It is just as likely that an alien from uranus landed on premoridalearth , took a dump , and we are all decended from an intergallactic tapeworm . BUT , kansas BOA standards currently have people teaching the primordial soup theiry as if it was proven . It is not . It is baseless conjecture . In fact , it is in contrast to generally accepted biological rules ( life does NOT come from nonliving matter ) . Persoanlly , I think both sides are wrong . I think that the evolutionists have fallen prey to the arrogance of the soft sciences . In striving to understand something , they have taken a relatively small body of evidence , made up a big story around it , and told themselves `` we know it all now `` rather than accepting that their explanation may not be entirely correct . the evolutionists ont he other hand ( YECs anyway ) .... well , that one is a no brainer . I personally can not find fault witht he intelligent design folks who feel that god guided evolution , since to disprove this you essentially have to disprove the existance of god , and nobody has ever managed to do so ( though the concept of an invisible man in the sky is a little silly ) .""",DISAGREE,"""the teaching of YEC likely to spread to other states ?""","""YEC really si n't an issue here"""

Va follows the old common law rules for self defense . From what I have read of the new ( and much criticized by the media elite ) Florida self defense bill , it sounds like Florida is just returning to the old common law standard for justifiable self-defense , where retreat to the wall is not required when faced with a threat of deadly force . The first I heard of the new law change in Fla. was from the misfortune of watching a CBS nightly news story on it . The reporter said with disbelief in his voice ( the kind of Â “ my God what are they doing ! Â ” panic you hear when someone passes a law they donÂ ’ t like ) that the new law states that if you shoot someone you are actually presumed innocent of any crime . My only comment on this is that the reporter obviously knows nothing of our legal system . Whenever any person is prosecuted for any crime , whether in Fla. or anywhere else in America , that person is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . I thought about e-mailing our standard jury instruction to the CBS guy : THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the defendant is presumed innocent . You should not assume the defendant is guilty because he has been indicted and is on trial . This presumption of innocence remains with the defendant throughout the trial and is enough to require you to find the defendant not guilty unless and until the Commonwealth proves each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt . This does not require proof beyond all possible doubt , nor is the Commonwealth required to disprove every conceivable circumstance of innocence . However , suspicion or probability of guilt is not enough for a conviction . There is no burden on the defendant to produce any evidence . A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on your sound judgment after a full and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case . In any event , I have heard the re-tread of the same old arguments again about Fla. becoming the Â “ wild , wild west , Â ” Â “ traffic accidents becoming shootouts , Â ” and Fla. becoming the Â “ gunshine state.Â ” These are the same arguments which were made when Fla. adopted a concealed carry law . I believe they will prove just as ignorant now as they did then .""",AGREE,"""Is there a link to the Pennsylvania laws like that .. that was very informative""","""Sorry , I ’ t know ’ s law or if there is a link to it"""

The NRA 's attempt to run a `` do n't touch `` campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda , but the anti-gun lobby 's attempt to run a `` do n't touch `` campaign is responsible social activity . 20 .

Guns cause violence , which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows . 25 . A majority of the population supports gun control , just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves . 26 . Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a `` weapon of mass destruction `` or an `` assault weapon. `` 27 . Most people ca n't be trusted , so we should have laws against guns , which most people will abide by because they can be trusted . 28 . The right of Internet pornographers to exist can not be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights , but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights . 29 .

2024,"""Dublin , California ( CNN ) -- It 's a Monday morning , and Vince Cefalu just got into work at his more than $ 150,000-a-year-job as a special agent of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives . '' It 's 9:30 . This is what I affectionately refer to as the cage , `` Cefalu , 51 , said . '' I am sitting here with an empty in box and nothing to do . I 'll keep you apprised. `` CNN gave Cefalu a video camera to document what he does at work . For five days , he recorded himself inside his own office . Cefalu said he was put in a job with little or nothing to do because he 's the victim of retaliation by ATF managers . After spending much of his nearly 24-year ATF career going undercover with motorcycle gangs and white supremacist groups , he now oversees equipment inventory . '' I spent my whole life standing up to bullies , `` Cefalu told CNN in an interview to air on AC360 Wednesday night . '' The bullies right now are government bureaucrats who are abusing their oath and abusing the expectations of the public . I 'm not leaving until this is resolved. `` Records show ATF supervisors claim he 's had performance and discipline issues . CNN has interviewed dozens of ATF supervisors , agents and employees around the country who said they 've been demoted or labeled troublemakers just for filing a complaint . Later on the same Monday in which he brought a video camera to work , Cefalu was still having a slow day . '' I 'm going to get something to eat , drag out the day a little bit , get some interaction with somebody ... Here I am , Safeway sandwich , a little news on , catching up on current affairs . I 've had a few phone calls , personal phone calls that I 've made , waiting for something to do. `` At 3 p.m. that day , he records himself , saying `` ... watching a little news , surfing the net , reading some e-mails , doing whatever , waiting for something to do . It 's good money for not a lot of work , I guess . I 'm being facetious , obviously. `` He said ATF managers turned against him after he reported in 2005 what he said was an illegal wiretap plan in a racketeering case . Records show ATF disputes his claims of the planned illegal wiretap . But he said that started a series of retaliatory measures that ended up in 2007 with him in a desk job . His only negative evaluation , he said , was the year after he criticized the planned wiretap . '' Had I not exposed some unethical , potentially criminal clearly outside policy conduct and actions by law enforcement that I was working with , none of this would have happened , `` Cefalu said . '' I would still be working in the field. `` '' I report to where they tell me to report to , and I sit for eight hours a day , and then I go home , `` he said . '' I do nothing. `` Cefalu filed a series of grievances and an age-discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , but an administrative judge ruled against him . His attorney is appealing that decision . And over the past several years , he 's also sent letters to members of Congress complaining about alleged fraud and mismanagement at the ATF . '' It 's almost like being in an abusive relationship , actually . It 's almost like domestic violence , really , `` said Hiram Andrades , a supervisor in ATF 's Washington field office . '' It 's just you think things are going to improve with each director , you think things will get better and improve , but they don't. `` Andrades , who has a pending discrimination complaint , claims he was discriminated against because he ca n't get promoted . '' I ca n't get a promotion even if my life depended on it . If my life depended on it , I 'd be dead by now , OK ? `` Andrades told CNN . '' This type of retaliation is n't good for the agency , it 's distracting and it 's not good for the American people . We need to make better use of our tax dollars . We need to use it for the mission versus this kind of stuff . This is very distracting and not good for anybody. `` ATF has not had a permanent director since Carl Truscott resigned in 2006 . The agency is being run by Kenneth Melson , who has been deputy director since 2009 . In an interview with CNN , Melson said he was not permitted to discuss employee cases . But he insisted that he does not tolerate any type of retaliation . '' When I first came into ATF -- when I went around and talked to people at headquarters and around the country -- my specific and very emphatic message was that everyone was to be treated with respect and dignity and there would not be retaliation , `` Melson said . '' I will not stand for retaliation against people who are abiding by our orders and reporting violations of law or regulations. `` '' Every allegation of retaliation does n't mean it 's true , `` Melson said . '' Every person you talked to who perceives it 's retaliation does n't mean that it 's retaliation , because there 's been no adjudication of that . They have n't brought it to anybody to try to resolve it . Be careful when you talk to someone about retaliation , because there are many misconceptions and parameters of retaliation -- some of which are misinformed. `` Asked about an employee who does virtually nothing all day , he said : `` Well , I will certainly look into it and find out why he is not doing anything all day. `` He added , `` I will make sure that he puts in a full day 's work , because everybody is going to put in a full day 's work at ATF. `` Since fiscal 2005 , ATF has paid a total of $ 1.6 million to settle discrimination claims , according to federal government records . For the same time period , the FBI paid out $ 1.3 million and the DEA paid $ 331,755 . In addition , records show , ATF has more discrimination complaints filed per employee than the DEA or the FBI . But Melson said complaints have gone down 40 percent since last year . And ATF officials added that the U.S . Marshals Service and Bureau of Prisons have more complaints per employee . John Taylor , a former ATF special agent based in Las Vegas , Nevada , said he was the target of retaliation after he wrote an anonymous letter to the agency 's inspector-general . In his 2006 letter , he alleged taxpayer money was being wasted on agents ' unnecessary trips to Las Vegas . Taylor told CNN he was the target of an investigation into who wrote the letter . '' They asked me did I write the letter . My response was , ' I do n't have to answer ' ... they tried to charge me with lying. `` He said he left ATF as soon as he was eligible to retire after 20 years , on December 31 , 2009 . '' I told my wife , I 'm not going to live if I stay here , `` Taylor told CNN . '' I was depressed . It was hell for me. `` Another agent in the Las Vegas office , who claims he was suspected of writing the anonymous letter , also alleged he was the target of retaliation by managers , according to records obtained by CNN . That agent was fired for failing to pass a firearms test , but later got his job back . ATF agents tell CNN that managers are taught how to handle discrimination complaints at supervisor meetings . CNN obtained a statement from a current ATF supervisor who attended such a meeting in March . During that meeting , ATF associate chief counsel Eleanor Loos gave a presentation to supervisors in the Atlanta field division . According to the statement , Loos stated that `` she considers the EEO process as the employees ' 'bitching platform ' and `` employees use this as a means to complain. `` '' Loos stated in a bragging manner that the EEO process can be dragged on and can take up to three years , `` the statement said . Rafiq Ahmad , the ATF supervisor who wrote the statement , added : `` This is not the first time that I have heard Eleanor Loos making similar remarks . She has presented these same remarks in presentations in New Supervisor 's training. `` Melson told CNN he had not seen the statement . '' But what I can tell you is that the direction that I have given people is to make sure that we abide by the rules of the agency , that we abide by the process of the EEO , and the ombudsman . And that 's why we have the process in place , `` Melson said . In a follow-up interview , Scot Thomasson , chief of ATF public affairs , told CNN that the bureau looked into the statements made by Loos . '' What we found is those statements were being taken out of context , `` Thomasson said . '' In addition , they were being characterized in a slanted matter by the person who wrote it. ``""","""Very intriguing .""",DISAGREE,"""In his 2006 letter , he alleged taxpayer money was being wasted on agents ' unnecessary trips to Las Vegas .

2522,"""Lately , itÂ ’ s been tough for us atheists . From recent scientific discoveries that show the amazing complexities of the simplest forms of life , the subsequent mathematical improbability of random , chance , godless processes producing and maintaining life , to people like Behe , Dembski , Spetner , and many websites untainted with liberalism and political correctness of the mainstream media , the movie Â “ ExpelledÂ ” that showed a very real probability of how weÂ ’ ve been so close to violating the U.S. Constitution in academia . Well I have news for Christians/conservatives Â– theyÂ ’ re the ones who are deluded ! [ insert stream of vulgar name calling here ] Because God does not exist Â– random chance made the universe with all its order and complexity ! How do I know this ? From Madelyn Murray OÂ ’ Hair ! She said so , she proved how smart she was when she won her Â “ separation of church and stateÂ ” lawsuit in 1963 ! She has garnered so many followers that also happened to have an interest in science , that theyÂ ’ ve managed to take over the scientific community ! How could they be wrong ? How could their current representatives , Dawkins and Harris , be wrong ? They obviously know all things ! Now , who should we believe , the Bible , written and preserved over the entire period of the human ability to write , no matter how many attempts have been made to destroy it , or Dawkins and Harris and their millions of followers in the scientific community ? It doesnÂ ’ t matter what the Bible says , Tiktaalik Roseaea is real ! A small band of atheist explorers said so ! We can look in telescopes and see all the galaxies we want ! We know it took that light hundreds of billions of years to reach us ! No God would have made the universe , and sat around that long waiting for us to be able to see it ! Heh heh , is science unbelievable or what ? Now , if you think we donÂ ’ t know how big those galaxies are , how many stars they contain , how many planets they contain that have life on them , how long it takes their light to get here ( accurate to only a few hundred light years , plus or minus ) , you must be deluded or something ! Just ask us , weÂ ’ ll tell you ! According to Christians , orderly , specified complexity in life and the universe show a mathematical improbability very close to impossibility of random , purposeless origins and existence of reality . ThatÂ ’ s ridiculous Â– all you have to do is note that someone wins the lottery just about every week despite that individuals almost impossible chances - that tells you that evolution HAD to have happened ! Dawkins and Harris clearly say that God does not exist , though some deluded non-atheist scientists say that chance canÂ ’ t fully explain evolution , let alone the origins of life . Dawkins has dreams that spacemen came long ago and sowed the seeds of life on earth then flew away , never to be seen again ! How could he be wrong Â– he knows all things ! ItÂ ’ s amazing how the Bible can give us such obviously sound advise concerning finances , morality , behavior , as well as such accurate predictions about the breakdown of those things , and be so wrong about everything that science tells us about politics , and liberalism [ Obama/Ried ] visual here ] and be so wrong about the age of the earth , or how long it takes light to reach us ! IÂ ’ m sure weÂ ’ ll find out life originated from lifeless matter someday , itÂ ’ s been just around the corner for 150 years now . Never mind that the corner keeps getting further and further away scientifically , weÂ ’ re going to find it really soon ! Look , IÂ ’ m an atheist , and us atheists , we understand that things like miracles that defy the laws of physics ( the origin of life by natural processes ) are the truth . We know there is no God , we will never question that , because we are 100 % certain that Madelyn Murray OÂ ’ Hair was right ! Christians arenÂ ’ t certain about anything Â– they donÂ ’ t know how God originated , or where he is ! They have no clue about all those galaxies like we do ! Clearly , stuff like morals and finances , and written history have no place in our lives in the 21st century , we must live by the words of Dawkins and Harris Â– soon they will be able to cure ALL diseases , make us all live forever , and count more galaxies for us ! So that when there is no more death or sorrow thanks to science , and people like Dawkins , Harris , and Obama are ruling over every aspect of our lives , theyÂ ’ ll inform me that theyÂ ’ re correct , and they 'll have ways of seeing to it that I agree with them .

2772,"""i think its finally settled that physical ( testable or tangible ) evidence of God can never be found . this is not only because of its elusive nature to science , but also because of religious requirements . from a scientic perspective , nothing ever occurs outside of the realm of phyical law . that is , physical laws are constant and unbreakable , and there is nothing new or unpredictable or inexplicable about them . because the laws of physics completely govern ever aspect of the universe , there is nothing left for a supernatural being to do , at least where the phsical realm is concerned . there is no supernatural phenomenon , and no occurance that natural physical laws do not affect from a religious perspective , knowledge of God can only come through faith . we already know that faith is certainty in the absence of rational evidence , in other word believing without evidence . Hebrews 11:6 says `` And without faith it is impossible to please him . For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. `` faith is the key to religion , and only through faith can religion be established . therefore , if some physical observation could verify God 's existence , then it would contradict what religion says about God . this is a real catch 22. you search for evidence to solidify your faith , but if evidence comes you dont need faith , and without faith you can not relate to God in all , as far as i 'm concrned , it is totally futile to seek rational proof of God 's existence . even if it was found , it wouldnt be found . i remember saying that it is possible to prove that God exists ; that is , in the event that God showed up and said `` hey , it 's Me ! '' . but even this can never happen , because such a scenario would contradict the bible , and thus not prove God exists as far as the bible is concerned . and when all is said and done , it still doesnt answer the question `` does God exist ? ``""","""But then it also does n't answer the question `` does anything exist `` , nor does it answer an infinite number of `` existence `` questions . Do `` trolls `` exist , follows the same reasoning . If you find one , they are no longer a fairy tale/imaginary creature , they are some organic life form that can be measured , tested , and quantified .. i.e . no longer an imaginary creature . So they can no more be found than god . So replace god/troll with an infinite number of other imaginary things and you 'll see why the question `` Does god exist ?

Nowhere in the old testament is there any reliable prophecy that predicts the nature or timing of Jesus .""","""Really . '' The voice of one crying in the wilderness : `` Prepare the way of the LORD ; Make straight in the desert a highway for our God . ( NKJV ) . `` Isaiah 40:3 `` In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea , and saying , 'Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand ! ' For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah , saying : 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness : Prepare the way of the LORD . . . ( NKJV ) . ' '' Matt . 3:1-3 John the Baptist came before Jesus Christ and let people know that He was coming . What a fascinating period of history . This prediction was given by the prophet Isaiah , 740-680 B.C . History tell us that John the Baptist did in fact come preaching repentance and baptism . '' But you , Bethlehem Ephrathah , though you are small among the clans of Judah , out of you will come . . . one who will be ruler over Israel , whose origins are from of old , from ancient times ( NIV ) . `` Micah 5:2 `` After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea , during the time of King Herod . . . ( NIV ) `` Matt . 2:1 Micah , 735 - 710 B.C. , tells us that the Christ or Messiah will be born in Bethlehem . It is recognized by all that Jesus was indeed born in Bethlehem . Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign : Behold , the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son , and shall call His name Immanuel ( NKJV ) . `` Isaiah 7:14 `` Joseph , son of David , do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife , for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit . And she will bring forth a Son , and you shall call His name JESUS , for He will save His people from their sins . . . His name [ is ] Immanuel ( NKJV ) `` Matt . 1:20-23 . '' This is what the LORD says : `` A voice is heard in Ramah , mourning and great weeping , Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted , because her children are no more ( NIV ) . `` Jer . 31:15 `` When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi , he was furious , and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under . . .then the [ prophecy ] was fulfilled ( NIV ) . `` Matt . 2:16-4:1 Through the prophet Jeremiah , 627 - 580 B.C. , God indicated that some of Israel 's children would be killed at the coming of the Messiah . '' When Israel was a child , I loved him , And out of Egypt I called My son. `` Hosea 11:1 `` Now when they had departed , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream , saying , `` Arise , take the young Child and His mother , flee to Egypt , and stay there until I bring you word ; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him . When he arose , he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt , and was there until the death of Herod , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , `` Out of Egypt I called My Son. `` ( NKJV ) . ' '' Matt . 2:13-15 This prophecy was given by the prophet Hosea around 750 B.C . This amazing prophecy says that Messiah would come from Egypt . Jesus had to be born into the family of David , born of a virgin , born in Bethlehem , children would die and Jesus come out of Egypt . The prophet must have wondered why Messiah would come out of Egypt . This did not fit the concept the Jews had about Messiah . This is God 's plan and these are God 's prophecies . '' They divide my garments among them , and for my clothing they cast lots ( NKJV ) . `` Ps . 22:18 `` Then they crucified Him , and divided His garments , casting lots , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet : `` They divided My garments among them , And for My clothing they cast lots ( NKJV ) . `` Matt . 27:35 After the soldiers crucified Jesus ( nailed Him to the cross ) , they gambled for Jesus ' clothes . Little did they know they were fulfilling a 1000 years old prophecy . The prediction was provided by God through King David . '' I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication ; then they will look on Me whom they pierced ( NKJV ) . `` Zech . 12:10 `` But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear , and immediately blood and water came out . For these things [ occurred ] that the Scripture should be fulfilled . . . `` They shall look on Him whom they pierced ( NKJV ) . `` John 19:34-37 Another isolated event predicted in 520-512 B.C . In A.D. 33 , some soldier thrust his spear into the side of Jesus to make sure that He would die before 6 pm that evening . Little did he realize that Jesus was already dead ( John 19:30 ) and that he was fulfilling a 480 year old prophecy from Zechariah . '' Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted , who ate my bread , has lifted up His heel against me ( NKJV ) . `` Ps . 41:9 `` Judas Iscariot . . . betrayed Him. `` Matt . 10:4 `` that the scripture might be fulfilled , 'He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me ( NKJV ) . `` John 13:21-28 This prediction was recorded by King David , 1020 - 970 B.C . It refers to the Messiah 's betrayal by His friends . Judas is well known as the one who agreed to help the Romans capture Jesus at a cost of 30 pieces of silver . Peter was another who betrayed Jesus three times . '' See , your king comes to you , righteous and having salvation , gentle and riding on a donkey , on a colt , the foal of a donkey ( NIV ) . `` Zech 9:9 `` And the disciples . . . brought the donkey and the colt , and laid on them garments , on which he sat . And most of the multitude spread their garments in the road , and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road ( NIV ) . `` Matt . 21:6-8 Zechariah , 480 - 470 B.C. , stated that Messiah , the king , would come riding on a donkey . Donkeys were sometimes ridden in times of peace ( Judges 5:10 ) but stallions were normally used by kings . This is unexpected by those looking for a military Messiah .

By what you 've said so far , it seems that all this law does is give woman the power to punish men if they get pregnant by them ; despite the fact that the woman was just as consenting as the man at the time of the coitus . There are also contraceptive paths for women that do n't involve condoms . If a woman gets pregnant because she forgot to take the pill that morning and always relied on that rather than on condoms to stop her getting pregnant , why should the man be punished ?

Therefore , it is impossible that God can do everything , and it is thus impossible for him to be all powerful . I ca n't claim originality for this proof , but I have never heard any good refutation of it , and yet people still act as if God is all powerful despite the absurdity of such a notion . If there is a refutation , then I 'd like to hear it .""","""The question is illogical . By declaring the existence of an all powerful God then saying God can not do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature . Your question by its very statement does not test wether or not God is all powerful but wether or not God is comprehensible . See another thread for that topic . The statement that God is all powerful defines his nature . To state then that he can not do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic .""",DISAGREE,"""God is all powerful despite the absurdity of such a notion""","""The statement that God is all powerful defines his nature"""

3589,"""NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- A U.S. judge Thursday became the second in the nation to rule that a federal ban on a particular type of late-term abortion is unconstitutional . In his ruling on the law dubbed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act , Judge Richard Conway Casey cited a high court ruling and a lack of exemption to protect the health of a woman . '' The Supreme Court ... informed us that this gruesome procedure may be outlawed only if there exists in medical consensus that there is no circumstance in which any woman could potentially benefit from it , `` Casey wrote in his ruling . '' A division of medical opinion exists , `` Casey wrote . '' Such a division means that the constitution requires a health exception. `` The plaintiffs in the suit -- seven physicians who perform abortions and the National Abortion Federation -- were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union . '' We 're quite pleased that the court recognized that this ban brought an attack on second-trimester abortions as early as 13 weeks in pregnancy , `` Lorraine Kenny , a spokeswoman for the ACLU , told CNN . The ban included no health exception and therefore would endanger women 's health , Kenny said . Planned Parenthood also applauded the decision . '' The abortion ban is a brazen affront to women 's health , the right to medical privacy and the U.S. Constitution and was rightfully struck down , `` Planned Parenthood President Gloria Feldt said in a statement released by the group . '' This ruling is a critical step toward ensuring that women and doctors -- not politicians -- can make private , personal health care decisions , `` Feldt added .

4176,"""There 's a huge hole in evolutionary theory and IÂ ’ m about to exploit it . IÂ ’ ve mentioned this before , but truly , mountains of books could be written on this subject . The subject , of course , is the illusion of evolution . My contention is that much of what is perceived as Â “ evolutionÂ ” is not actually not evolution at all . Part of the problem 20th century scientists had was their definition of Â “ evolution.Â ” Intellectual wars have been fought for the past 150 years about where new traits come from and how they get passed on . Regardless , each side has tried to explain how the information from the environment gets transmitted to offspring . On one side you have Darwinists , who claim that evolution is a two-step process . First thereÂ ’ s random genetic mutation , and thatÂ ’ s followed up by non-random natural selectionÂ….the two combine to have the effect of transmitting environmental Â “ fitnessÂ ” to their offspring . Lamarckian inheritance , on the other hand , is a one-step process where the organism simply perceives the environment , adapts phenotypically and passes on these adaptations to their progeny . But thereÂ ’ s a hole . A gaping hole that nobody has seemed to exploit . And this hole bypasses both theories . WhatÂ ’ s the hole ? The hole is that inheritance of new traits is not necessary for Â “ evolution.Â ” In other words , populational evolution does not require traits to be `` passed on. `` This mantra is a giant straw man , as you will soon see , because much -- if not all -- of what we see in the field is merely a matter of environmental evolution . The reality is that a change in phenotype is observed as evolution in the field and in the fossil record . But there is no way to tell from the fossils -- or from non-controlled scientific experiments -- whether new traits are caused by variation arising in the genotype or only from environmental effects acting on the phenotype . Not only that , but thereÂ ’ s also no way to tell without close inspection if these traits are inherited or acquired . ItÂ ’ s well known that animal embryo development brings about a collaboration between the genetic program , internal signals from the mother , and external signals from the environment . Somehow the embryo processes this information and emerges accordingly . Therefore , the same genome can emerge with different phenotypes depending on environment or external circumstance . This is known as differentiation , and is simply the convergence of an organismÂ ’ s genes and environment during development . Moths and butterflies are perfect example of this phenomenon . As well , tadpoles can not only change the size and shape of their heads , it 's also known that the presence of predators can influence their tail size , shape , color , hatch times and general size of the organism .

If the food supply stuck around long enough time , it could give the appearance that the population was Â “ evolving.Â ” But genetics would have nothing to do with it Â– instead , it would simply be a cultural , environmental phenomenon . ItÂ ’ s an environmental evolution , of sorts . Of course this leaves natural selection out of a job because the entire population would be evolving new , beneficial morphologies without it . Not only that but it bypasses the ridiculous premise that science has constructed for itself -- - which says that new , beneficial traits have to be Â “ passed on.Â ” This is a bogus premise from the very start because itÂ ’ s not necessary for traits to be Â “ passed onÂ ” for new morphologies to carry forward into future generations -- all that 's needed is , in this case , for a specific diet to continue to be available to future generations -- which , of course , would carry on those particular traits .

The subject , of course , is the illusion of evolution . My contention is that much of what is perceived as Â “ evolutionÂ ” is not actually not evolution at all . Part of the problem 20th century scientists had was their definition of Â “ evolution.Â ” Intellectual wars have been fought for the past 150 years about where new traits come from and how they get passed on . Regardless , each side has tried to explain how the information from the environment gets transmitted to offspring . On one side you have Darwinists , who claim that evolution is a two-step process . First thereÂ ’ s random genetic mutation , and thatÂ ’ s followed up by non-random natural selectionÂ….the two combine to have the effect of transmitting environmental Â “ fitnessÂ ” to their offspring . Lamarckian inheritance , on the other hand , is a one-step process where the organism simply perceives the environment , adapts phenotypically and passes on these adaptations to their progeny . But thereÂ ’ s a hole . A gaping hole that nobody has seemed to exploit . And this hole bypasses both theories . WhatÂ ’ s the hole ? The hole is that inheritance of new traits is not necessary for Â “ evolution.Â ” In other words , populational evolution does not require traits to be `` passed on. `` This mantra is a giant straw man , as you will soon see , because much -- if not all -- of what we see in the field is merely a matter of environmental evolution . The reality is that a change in phenotype is observed as evolution in the field and in the fossil record . But there is no way to tell from the fossils -- or from non-controlled scientific experiments -- whether new traits are caused by variation arising in the genotype or only from environmental effects acting on the phenotype . Not only that , but thereÂ ’ s also no way to tell without close inspection if these traits are inherited or acquired . ItÂ ’ s well known that animal embryo development brings about a collaboration between the genetic program , internal signals from the mother , and external signals from the environment . Somehow the embryo processes this information and emerges accordingly . Therefore , the same genome can emerge with different phenotypes depending on environment or external circumstance . This is known as differentiation , and is simply the convergence of an organismÂ ’ s genes and environment during development . Moths and butterflies are perfect example of this phenomenon .

The newly evolved shoe-wearing gene was selected for , as females with leather booties were less likely to cut their feet and acquire a deadly infection . This prolonged lifespan set up a selective pressure to develop a shoe fetish among males . Males who became attracted to the booties would be at an advantage , as they would more likely impregnate the bootie women who in turn would be more likely to survive to take care of their sperm products . Your hypothesis falls apart with your first statement . We all know that it would have been impossible for only `` some `` of them to have shoes .

I also find it hard to believe some of what gets posted in favor of the slippery slope argument- such as claims that Sarah Brady wants all guns to be banned which are contradicted by quotes by her in credible online sources and also such statistics as `` [ i ] t is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America `` which have little basis in fact : `` The belief that there are approximately 20,000 gun-control laws in the United States has become received wisdom ..... But as it turns out , there appears to be little basis for the number .... Since the early 1980s , the National Rifle Association has mounted a very successful campaign to encourage state governments to enact 'preemption ' laws , forbidding local governments from enacting their own gun laws . Today , more than 40 states preempt all or most local gun-control laws , which has likely reduced the overall number of local gun laws .... Clearly the 20,000 figure is more a product of advocacy than science . And however it was initially derived , the trend toward preemption of local laws has substantially reduced the total . The most informative answer to the question of 'how many gun-control laws ? ' is then 'about 300 major state and federal laws , and an unknown but shrinking number of local laws . ' '' http : //www.brookings.edu/es/urban/pu ... s/gunbook4.pdf So why does the slippery slope fallacy keep appearing despite a Supreme Court ruling that stands in the way of it becoming a reality , a decline in the number of gun laws , and little or no credible evidence to suggest that gun control advocates really do intend to ban all guns ? Could it be that pro-gun extremists find it necessary to resort to the slippery slope fallacy because they find it otherwise difficult to make a convincing argument against reasonable and common sense gun laws aimed at protecting law abiding citizens from gun violence and the misuse of firearms ?""","""From your source which indeed does have its own slippery slope built in . '' Another problem with estimating the number of gun laws is agreeing on a definition of just what is to be included . For example , many local laws prohibit carrying or firing guns in public places . Inclusion of such laws would certainly inflate national estimates of the number of gun laws. `` And here comes tada one of the slippery slopes . '' But if one considers only laws that control the manufacture , design , sale , purchase , or possession of gunsÂ—the cluster of laws many probably imagine as constituting gun-control lawsÂ—the number of local laws will be much smaller . With most gun laws containing numerous , interrelated subparts , there is also no clear rule for defining what should count as a separate law. `` And yet another . '' In short , no matter how the 20,000- gun-law figure was initially derived , the overwhelming trend toward preemption of local laws is likely to have substantially reduced the total . Even a very liberal interpretation of what should count as a separate law would leave the total well short of 20,000. `` Yea right ! '' In our view , the discovery that there may be as few as 300 major statewide laws that fit our definition of a gun-control statute ( with some states having as few as one or two such laws ) yields a far more appropriate figure for public-policy discussion. `` In other words we do n't really have a clue here but we 'll call it short so we win . Nice try though .""",DISAGREE,"""slippery slope fallacy the arguments of pro-gun activists""","""slippery slope built in very liberal interpretation"""

First , the Mr. Hayes was convicted of this crime before the Lautenberg Amendment was passed . Secondly , Virginian law ( where the case originates from ) makes no distinction between a domestic relationship ( that which he was tried and convicted of ) and between the agressor .

They basically expanded the meaning of the Lautenberg Amendment , which is a big NO NO ! I think that is what Justice Roberts was saying in his dissent . Quote Justice Roberts dissent : That reading does not require the specified domestic relationship in clause ( ii ) to be an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute . Individuals convicted under generic use-of-force statutes containing no reference to domestic violence would there-fore be subject to prosecution under Â§922 ( g ) ( 9 ) . ....

This seems such simple common sense that it has been very persuasive . Nevertheless , it is not difficult to show that the argument is fallacious . A number of general points can be made . First , the argument is based on ignorance of all the different ways in which Christian faith can enter into science and of how fruitful these have been . After all , many of the great scientists of the past were committed Christians and many of those were consciously exploring the implications of their Christian faith for science . Second , whereas the direct action of God may cut off one type of explanation , others will remain and may even be enhanced . To say that God created the different kinds of animals and plants certainly cuts off explanation in terms of evolutionary continuity . However , it leaves wide-open scientific investigation of every other pattern of relationship ( ecological , developmental , etc . ) between these kinds . Scientists have been so indoctrinated in the belief that all patterns can only be explained historically in terms of the happenstances of Darwinian evolution that many wouldnÂ ’ t even know how to look for explanations in other terms . Third , there is abundant documentation of the fact that evolutionary naturalism has often stopped scientific research . To take just one example , the evolutionary assumption that certain organs or features are vestigial has often long delayed the ( fruitful ) research into their functions .

During my undergraduate days when my Â “ hereticalÂ ” views became known , my professor ( Otto Lowenstein , Professor of Zoology ) made a point of telling me that no creationist would be allowed to do research in his department ! However , he did allow me to do research . From the pressure that was put on me , I can only assume that it was thought that I could be convinced of the error of my ways . If that was the intention , then it badly backfired . Many a visiting scholar was brought into my laboratory to convince me , from their area of expertise , that evolution was indisputably true . Of course , hardly knowing their field , I never had an answer at the time , but after they had gone I would look up the relevant research and carefully analyze it . I always found that the evolutionist case was much weaker than it had seemed and that alternative creationist interpretations were available which were just as or more convincing . My position was further strengthened by the results of my own research .""","""http : //www.answersingenesis.org/home/Area/isd/jones.asp When Judge John Jones of Dover Pa. was considering evidence from persuasive evolutionists concerning what should be taught in schools , could it be that he `` hardly knew the field , and did n't have an answer `` that would fit the time constraints of his decision making ?

5604,"""Perhaps those who are more knowledgeable on this can tell me ... The main purpose of a scientific theory is to establish a model that can explain phenomena observed in the natural world . An example is that we find chemical reactions always result in the same amount of mass as when you started . This , along with many other observations led to atomic theory . Now , let 's say that some chemical reaction was performed and it seemed as though there was mass produced by the reaction . Initially , this would be seen as an anomaly or faulty experimentation . If other people observed the same results similar conditions , an alteration of atomic theory , or a new model that is completely different from atomic theory , would have to be produced . However , even if this hypothetical experiment was confirmed , you would not throw out atomic theory as wrong without another theory to replace it . Atomic theory is a very useful model , backed up by massive amounts of observations and provides excellent predictions for the result of reactions that have n't occurred . To replace that , a model that explains all those previous observations plus this new anomaly must be made . It is also helpful if this new model can make predictions on phenomena that have n't yet occurred . An example would be when the periodic table was first produced ; it was able to give a reasonably accurate prediction of chemicals that had not yet been discovered . The question I 'm posing for this thread is , what exactly the theory of creation that will replace evolution is . This theory would have to : 1 . Explain the fossil record as it stands either by showing that creation occurred multiple times or that all species existed at the same time . 2 . Explain genetic modification and propose how responsible it is for alteration in organisms 3 . Present a model of interaction that can make predictions about life forms in the way evolution currently does 4 . Present a new system of classification ( the current Kingdom Phylum Class etc etc . is mostly an evolutionary system ) 5 . Be experimentally verifiable . If there is no extensive evidence supporting the previous claims , they can not form a stable theory .

6501,"""First , a comment about your second link . Gould had this to say about the quotes on that page : It seems that creationists are still at it . Yes . That is one component of evolutionary thought . But there is more to it than that . Another component of evolutionary thought is that many times species remain static ( as far as the fossil record reveals ) for long periods of time , sometimes millions of years . Another component of evolutionary thought is that sometimes speciation can happen relatively rapidly , in a flash of geological time , maybe as little as 50 or 60 thousand years . Even Darwin hypothesized that changes that caused speciation took place in peripheral segments of the population . Just before World War II Dobzhansky and Mayr discussed the gaps in the fossil record and the reasons for them . They agreed with Darwin . Finally , in the 1960s Eldredge and Gould worked out the first statement of what became the theory of punctuated equilibria in which they elaborated on the previous thoughts of Darwin , Dobzhansky , and Mayr . I think their paper , in which they discussed their observations from the fossil record of just such events , was published in 1972 . Actually , the fossil record does support it . Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it . Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area . These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another . But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population , and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place , we do n't expect to find many examples in the fossil record . It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd . dash with a sundial . The fossil record just is n't fine grained enough to see the rapid ( 50-60 thousand years ) changes . Nope . It does . Or maybe it supports the hypothesis of successive creation . The fossil record that we find certainly does n't support the creation as told in the Bible . Even the creationists who went in search of evidence of the flood some 200 years ago realized that the geology did n't support what the Bible said . So they thought that the geology represented many floods , the last one from the Bible being on top . This objection has already been answer by Gould in the quote above . But of course , what creationists demand is eyedropper precision from a fire hose . Nevertheless , we have some spectacular transitional forms . My favorite is Archaeopteryx .

7308,"""City Hall & # 8211 ; Speaker Christine C Quinn , together with Council Member Al Vann , today announced legislation that would increase penalties for selling a toy gun by 500 percent . The legislation would also enhance the Department of Consumer Affairs & # 8217 ; enforcement ability and allow the agency to shut stores that are repeat offenders of the law . Department of Consumer Affairs ( DCA ) Commissioner Jonathan Mintz and Criminal Justice Coordinator John Feinblatt joined the Speaker and Council Members at the announcement . The officials also announced a new citywide public awareness campaign about the dangers of toy guns that look real and real guns that look like toys . & # 8220 ; Despite the fact that New York City & # 8217 ; s toy and imitation gun law has been in existence for several years many merchants continue to sell items that resemble real guns , & # 8221 ; said Council Speaker Quinn . & # 8220 ; Our communities are at risk when they can not tell a fake toy gun from a real one and the dangers these items present are all too real . Children have been hurt and even killed as a result of these guns being out in our communities. & # 8221 ; The City Council & # 8217 ; s Consumer Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on the legislation this afternoon . The proposed bill would increase the fine for a first violation from $ 1,000 to up to $ 5,000 . It would also increase the fines for subsequent violations within a two year period from $ 3,000 to up to $ 8,000 . Finally , it would also permit DCA to seal , for up to five days , the premises of a store found guilty of three or more violations within a two year period .

7928,"""Hey , bring it on . A month ago , I read over your 'failed prophecies ' and if you are ready to listen , there is no problem explaining what happened with Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt . It is mature fare and hard for even Christians to accept sometimes , but the long and short of it is this : you do n't even begin to know the God you are dealing with . If you give me a space of time to get things together , I can introduce you to a being who is so much like you that you will almost be fooled into feeling that you 're his `` buddy `` then I will introduce you to the same being who can tear you to pieces if he chooses ( Ps . 50 ) Here 's a hint though about what happened in Egypt : God changed his mind . But you did n't know he could do that ? You would be surprised how much like you he really is . He changed his mind several times in the text of the Bible : Abraham tried to get Him to but could n't get Him to stop his destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , God was out to kill Moses ' sons , but Moses quickly circumcised them and God changed his mind , also Moses succeeded in changing God 's mind when Moses learned that He was out to destroy the Israelites , God was determined to level Ninevah but after Jonah preached He changed his mind because the people repented , God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah saying : When I pronounce judgment on a peoples but they later turn from their sins , I will change my mind concerning the judgment I had determined on them . But be careful - when He is set on doing something , it gets done . Just when you think you have a `` pal `` in God , he says something like this to the prophet Ezekiel : when a land sins against Me , though Noah and Daniel and Job are in it , they will deliver but their own souls . Even righteous Noah could n't stay the hand of the Almighty when He was dead set on destroying the first world . Real quick : one of the major ways God judges a people group is via another wicked people or wicked king . Happens time and time again in scripture . Do n't have time to elaborate right now . Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked king and in God 's hand he was simply a pawn to use to punish other nations . So while God is using him to punish Egypt , He is punishing Nebuchadnezzar and his nation as well . Get it ? Is it too mature for you ? Do n't believe it ? Too bad .... it 's true . God will bring a nation to full dominance and power in order to punish other nations .

7928,"""Hey , bring it on . A month ago , I read over your 'failed prophecies ' and if you are ready to listen , there is no problem explaining what happened with Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt . It is mature fare and hard for even Christians to accept sometimes , but the long and short of it is this : you do n't even begin to know the God you are dealing with . If you give me a space of time to get things together , I can introduce you to a being who is so much like you that you will almost be fooled into feeling that you 're his `` buddy `` then I will introduce you to the same being who can tear you to pieces if he chooses ( Ps . 50 ) Here 's a hint though about what happened in Egypt : God changed his mind . But you did n't know he could do that ? You would be surprised how much like you he really is . He changed his mind several times in the text of the Bible : Abraham tried to get Him to but could n't get Him to stop his destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , God was out to kill Moses ' sons , but Moses quickly circumcised them and God changed his mind , also Moses succeeded in changing God 's mind when Moses learned that He was out to destroy the Israelites , God was determined to level Ninevah but after Jonah preached He changed his mind because the people repented , God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah saying : When I pronounce judgment on a peoples but they later turn from their sins , I will change my mind concerning the judgment I had determined on them . But be careful - when He is set on doing something , it gets done . Just when you think you have a `` pal `` in God , he says something like this to the prophet Ezekiel : when a land sins against Me , though Noah and Daniel and Job are in it , they will deliver but their own souls . Even righteous Noah could n't stay the hand of the Almighty when He was dead set on destroying the first world . Real quick : one of the major ways God judges a people group is via another wicked people or wicked king . Happens time and time again in scripture . Do n't have time to elaborate right now . Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked king and in God 's hand he was simply a pawn to use to punish other nations . So while God is using him to punish Egypt , He is punishing Nebuchadnezzar and his nation as well . Get it ? Is it too mature for you ? Do n't believe it ? Too bad .... it 's true . God will bring a nation to full dominance and power in order to punish other nations . When He is through using them , He will often turn His wrath on the punishing nation who was His original `` servant `` so to speak . This is mature teaching . Most Christians do n't like it .

8091,"""SIOUX FALLS , S.D . Â— In the fight to preserve the toughest abortion ban in the nation , the talk is not of a fetus ' right to life . It 's of a woman 's right to motherhood . Antiabortion activists here deliberately avoid the familiar slogans of their movement . They do n't talk about the `` murder of innocent babies `` or quote the Bible on the sanctity of life . Instead , campaign manager Leslee Unruh has taken what she calls a feminist approach , arguing that legalized abortion exploits women and Â— for their sake Â— must be stopped . ADVERTISEMENT The bumper stickers and T-shirts that fill campaign headquarters spell out her message , in pink and blue : `` Abortion Hurts Women. `` '' We women buy the choice line . We 're panicked , or we 're being pressured , or we 're ashamed to have a child outside marriage , `` Unruh said . She speaks from personal experience ; she had an abortion nearly 30 years ago and said her life since has been darkened with regret and longing . '' If you do n't do your job right as a mother , `` Unruh asked , `` what good is everything else ? `` Abortion-rights supporters call such rhetoric patronizing and presumptuous ; they say many women find that ending unwanted pregnancies brings relief and the freedom to pursue other dreams . But they acknowledge that Unruh 's tactic is effective Â— and that it has thrown their campaign off balance . '' Historically , this debate has been focused on fetal rights , fetal life . We have a lot of language about that , `` said Sarah Stoesz , president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota and North and South Dakota . '' This adds an element we 're not accustomed to . It 's a different line of debateÂ… . And that is something we struggle with politically. `` The ban , passed overwhelmingly by the South Dakota Legislature in February , makes it a felony to help any woman terminate a pregnancy at any stage , unless an abortion is necessary to prevent her death . Women would not face criminal charges , but their doctors could get up to five years in prison . Rather than challenge the law in court , Planned Parenthood chose to put it to a public referendum , gambling that people would vote to repeal it on Nov. 7 . ( South Dakota law permits interest groups to refer legislation to the ballot if they can collect enough signatures . ) If voters reject the ban , abortion-rights advocates hope it will deter states such as Ohio , Indiana , Missouri , Georgia and Rhode Island , which have been considering similar measures . If the ban is upheld , Planned Parenthood will challenge it in court . Antiabortion leaders would welcome that battle . They hope the U.S. Supreme Court will use the case to overturn Roe vs. Wade , the 1973 ruling that found a constitutional right to abortion . Both sides call this election crucial and are putting out urgent appeals to raise millions of dollars for the fight . But if this is the frontline of the abortion wars , the guns sound oddly muted . Attuned to the values of this very conservative state , abortion-rights activists have decided not to make a stand on a woman 's right to choose . The big poster outside their campaign headquarters makes a much milder point : `` This law simply goes too far. `` One of their TV ads starts out : `` South Dakotans agree , honor and protect human life. `` The ad goes on to affirm support for reducing the number of abortions , but argues that the law is too inflexible . The only exception in the law states physicians will not be prosecuted for procedures `` intended to prevent the death of a pregnant mother. `` Even then , however , doctors must try their best to save `` the life of her unborn child. `` A provision allows women to use the morning-after pill , which can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of sex . But under South Dakota law , pharmacists are not required to dispense the pill Â— or refer women to a pharmacy that will . And the Legislature has repeatedly voted down a bill to require emergency rooms to stock the contraceptive . Walking a neighborhood of gracious homes the other day to rally voters against the law , Emma Tupper , 20 , made just one pitch , again and again . '' Our main concern is the lack of exception for rape and incest , `` she said . Some residents nodded and pledged to vote against the ban . Nearly as many politely said they would support it . '' Even if there 's no exception for rape and incest ? `` Tupper asked one elderly man . '' I 've looked at the bill pretty closely , and I feel comfortable with my decision , `` he replied , and closed the door . Tupper Â— who came from Seattle to work on this campaign Â— walked on , crunching through drifts of yellow leaves . '' It 's a tough state , `` she said . An independent Mason-Dixon poll in June found voters opposed to the ban , 47 % to 39 % . But a Zogby International survey last month , commissioned by an antiabortion group in Washington , D.C. , found that gap had narrowed to 47 % to 44 % .

8141,"""Vermont legalizes gay marriage -- chicagotribune.com chicagotribune.com Vermont legalizes gay marriage The Associated Press 6:57 PM CDT , April 7 , 2009 MONTPELIER , Vt. -- The marriage proposal came not over a candlelit dinner or on a scenic mountaintop ; instead the couple were surrounded by a throng of gay rights supporters outside the Vermont House chamber . '' We have n't decided who 's going to propose to who yet , `` former lawmaker Robert Dostis said as he stood next to his longtime partner , Chuck Kletecka . '' But we 've been together 25 years in September , and I think September 14th would be a nice wedding day. `` '' Sounds good to me , `` Kletecka replied . '' I accept. `` The exchange came just after the Vermont House narrowly achieved the two-thirds majority necessary to overcome Republican Gov . Jim Douglas ' veto of a gay marriage bill . Vermont was the first state to give gay and lesbian couples legal recognition with its civil unions law in 2000 . It jumped to the lead again Tuesday : After courts in three other states had legalized gay marriage , Vermont became the first to have its Legislature do so on its own . Bills to allow same-sex marriage are currently before lawmakers in New Hampshire , Maine , New York and New Jersey . The three other states that allow same-sex marriage -- Connecticut , Massachusetts and Iowa -- moved to do so first through the courts , not their legislatures . '' For a popularly elected legislature to make this decision is a much more democratic process `` because lawmakers have to answer to the voters every other November , said Eric Davis , a retired Middlebury College political science professor . Courts typically deal with arcane points of constitutional law . While legislatures debate some of the same principles , the process may become much more personal . In Vermont , some of the most gripping debate came when gay lawmakers took to the House floor last Thursday and told their own love stories . Getting gay marriage approved in a political , rather than purely legal , forum is a big step , said Boston University law professor Linda McLain , an expert on family law and policy . '' What may give courage to other legislatures is that this legislature managed to do it , `` she said . She added that using the civil rights language of equality -- the measure in Vermont was dubbed the marriage equality bill -- could help make gay marriage more acceptable elsewhere . Opponents said they , too , believe activists will be emboldened in other states and could attack the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act , which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman and provides that states need not recognize the marriage of a same-sex couple from another state . The Vermont action comes just days after the Iowa Supreme court ruled that not permitting gay marriage there was unconstitutional . '' To the millions of Americans who care about marriage , we say , 'Get ready . President Obama and Democrats will use Vermont as an excuse to overturn the bipartisan federal Defense of Marriage Act , ' `` said Brian Brown , executive director of the National Organization for Marriage , which waged a radio campaign against the measure . '' The next step is to ask the Supreme Court to impose gay marriage on all 50 states. `` To date , the same-sex marriage movement 's main gains have been in New England , which some attribute to Yankee liberalism and the gradual acceptance of gay relationships after Vermont 's groundbreaking civil unions law took effect in 2000 . Douglas had announced his intent to veto the gay marriage bill two weeks ago , saying he believed marriage should be limited to a man and a woman and calling the issue a distraction from more important economic and budgetary issues . In Tuesday 's vote , a yes was needed from two-thirds of those present to override the governor 's veto . The goal was easily achieved in the Senate , which voted 23-5 , but in the House the vote was much closer , 100-49 . The speaker 's announcement of the results to a packed Statehouse chamber set off whistles and cheers among supporters whose hopes had been temporarily dashed when the governor announced he would veto the measure if it passed the Legislature . Among the celebrants were Kletecka and Dostis , who recalled efforts to expand gay rights dating to an anti-discrimination law passed in 1992 . '' It 's been almost 20 years to get to this point , `` Dostis said . '' I think finally , most people in Vermont understand that we 're a couple like any other couple . We 're as good and as bad as any other group of people. `` Craig Bensen , a gay marriage opponent who had lobbied unsuccessfully for a nonbinding referendum on the question , said his side was outspent by supporters by 20-1 . '' The other side had a highly funded , extremely well-oiled machine with all the political leadership except the governor pushing to make this happen , `` he said . '' The fact that it came down to this tight a vote is really astounding. `` The measure had only 95 yes votes when it passed the House on Friday . But some changed their votes Tuesday . Rep. Jeff Young , D- St. Albans , who voted no twice because he 's philosophically opposed to gay marriage , joined most other Democrats in voting to override Douglas ' veto . '' I think if I wanted to continue my career here and have any chance of being effective , I had to vote with my caucus , `` he said . '' You have some pet projects , you think you can help your district back home with things that need to happen . I want to get a railroading bill through . I would n't even have had a chance to testify , let alone get it through . Now , people will listen to me . It 's the way the political game is played. `` Copyright 2009 Associated Press .
