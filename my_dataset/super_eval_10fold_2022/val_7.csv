To a Darwinist , just because an animal changes phentoypically , or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that Â “ evolutionÂ ” has occurred . A fish could morph into a human , but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered `` evolution. `` The only way evolution can happen , by their own definition , is if there is a change in genetics . This premise , I suggest is a complete and total fraud ... and I will explain why now : LetÂ ’ s take humans and dogs , for example . When compared side-by-side , sure enough , humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not Â– and possibly the other way around . But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs do n't , does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs . Of course , there are no Â “ dog genesÂ ” or Â “ human genes.Â ” But likewise there are no Â “ tongue genes , Â ” Â “ tail genesÂ ” or Â “ toenail genes.Â ” Parts are not translated genes . Thus , the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible . But it 's worse than that . As I said before , humans have a whole slew of genes Â– theoretically , at least -- that dogs ( or other animals ) donÂ ’ t have . But evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms ! ThatÂ ’ s why they analyze DNA with such scrutiny ! But did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are ? Scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have ... But theyÂ ’ ve got it backwards ! Instead , we have the genes we have because of who we are . A dog is n't a dog because he barks ; a dog barks because of what he is . Same with genes . This , of course , spells destructin to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud . Evolution , thus , should not be a theory based on changes in genes , but a theory based on changes in traits . But scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them . They simply wonÂ ’ t give up because theyÂ ’ ve seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses . But hereÂ ’ s where theyÂ ’ re screwing everything up : When you were a kid did you ever stand on your head ? If so , did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time ? If so , do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head ? Or , do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red ? ThatÂ ’ s excactly what science is doing with genetics : theyÂ ’ ve got the audacity to claim that changes in genes ( the red face ) is causing the organsim to change physiologically ( go upside down . ) In reality , whatÂ ’ s happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment ( turning upside down ) and then the genes are responding in kind ( turning red ) . The only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things : 1 ) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures . 2 ) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over .

He likely would have stated that any two animals receiving differential rewards would have likely learned that if they wait then they also will receive a more liked item . Not a sense of justice but learning by observation . Tolman further would argue that conditioned taste responses for the monkey receiving the preferred reward would be of greater value . In other words , if they were rewarded sometime when they did n't do anything would their work rate go down compared to the other monkey ? Would the other monkey continue at the same rate although it may not accept the less preferred food ?

One less species .""","""Jurassic Theropods like Compsognathus had hollow bones . http : //www.cbv.ns.ca/marigold/histor ... gnathuspic.jpg Therepodian dinosaurs show clear general skeletal affinities with modern birds such as long limbs , hollow bones , foot with 3 toes in front and 1 reversed toe behind and a long ilium . Coelophysis , from the late Triassic was one of the first theropod dinosaurs . Deinonychus and Oviraptor from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous were bipedal advanced theropods , larger , with more bird-like skeletal features : semilunate carpal , bony sternum , long arms and reversed pubis . Striking detailed similarity to birds . There is a gap in the fossil record here although Protoavis could belong here , unfourtunately , the fossil is poor . Archaeopteryx from 225 Ma , shows a mosaic of reptilian and avian features , with the reptilian features predominating . The skull and skeleton are basically reptilian ( skull , teeth , vertebrae , sternum , ribs , pelvis , tail , digits , claws , generally unfused bones ) . Bird traits are limited to an avian furcula ( wishbone , for attachment of flight muscles ; recall that at least some dinosaurs had this too ) , modified forelimbs , and -- the real kicker -- unmistakable lift-producing flight feathers . Archeopteryx could probably flap from tree to tree , but could n't take off from the ground , since it lacked a keeled breastbone for large flight muscles , and had a weak shoulder compared to modern birds . ( Wellnhofer , 1993 ) S. santensis from 138 Ma was a better flyer than Archaeopteryx . It had a short trunk , claws on the toes , flight-specialized shoulders , stronger flight- feather bones , tightly folding wrist and short hands . A not yet named bird/dino from 131 Ma has a reptilian pelvis and legs , with bird-like shoulders . The tail is medium-length with a fused tip . Then there 's Hesperornis , Ichthyornis , and other Cretaceous diving birds . There are many fossils . Their skeleton is further modified for flight showing fusion of pelvis bones , fusion of hand bones and a short , fused tail ) . It also still had true socketed teeth , a reptilian trait . There are others and this is by no mean exhaustive . This is just to show that there are very good transition lineages . Although no modern birds have teeth , chicken bills can be induced to develop teeth , indicating that chickens still retain the genes for making teeth . There is also an intriguing fossil Microraptor gui that has flight feathers on both the front and back legs . http : //eur.news1.yimg.com/eur.yimg.c ... 2567138235.jpg I can provide more info on any of these if you wish .

If we can include `` evolutionism `` among the sciences , then as a science it does not , indeed it can not , attribute metaphysical causes to physical effects . There is no such thing as `` metaphysical evidence `` . As you are content to describe yourself as a Christian Evolutionist , you invite the question , `` How do you account for the origins of life without invoking a Final Cause for which there is no scientific evidence ? ``""","""This brings up an interesting point , and that is that science is extremely limited . Using your logic , persons should not have believed in the fact that the earth is a round object floating in space before it was proven scientifically , even though it was a fact then , as it is now . This fact was written about in scripture long before science `` proved `` it , just as the description of the hydrological system was described in scripture long before scientists figured it out . THIS is where the evidence can be found for the validity of the Bible . When you find scripture after scripture of historical fact and scientific reference that is found to be accurate , you should tend to take is seriously . The problem with science is its arrogance . It 's inability to see that truth can be found in other areas is a real handicap . Add to that theories like evolution that disguise themselves as science , and you have a real problem .

When you look at humans and apes as being of a different nature , some quantum leap had to have occurred . While the physical ( common usage ) human may have evolved from ape , that essense of what makes humans human occurred in a much different manner . Comparing the DNA of humans and apes tells us nothing about the differences of the two . That which makes humans human does not reside in the physical self , it is of another nature . So the creationist are right in concept at least . In short the limited theory of quantum potential simply contends the nature of our existence is to recognize our potential , to prepare for the next quantum leap . Once that idea is internalized , one can see how limited our current views are .""","""You 've got it backwards , disorder in the universe is increasing , ( see entropy ) .

The claim had been made by your side ... that he had n't published an attempt to apply his filter . And , that he was running scarred . Are you now asking me to show where he has successfully demonstrated his filter , or are you asking me if he 's attempted to demonstrate his filter ... ? And now you want his publication in a particular form too ! Another slight of hand . Despite this I countered that he has published . I said Dembski had come up with a filter The accusation was that he had n't applied this to a biological system . Yet everyone seems to be able to critique this 'invisible ' application . Now with typical aplomb WJA chimes in and you do n't go down the path of SLP in actually making any claim . You want me to come up with the goods . This is the neat trick . You 've diverted things away from SLP 's ludicrous and biased claim . The claim was made by SLP without any proof . The onus is on SLP to provide such proof . I have shown otherwise even if it is 'second hand evidence ' . The inference from all the critiques quite clearly suggest that they have seen it applied , and reject it as a failure . Nice try WJA . A small shift again of the argument . However , because I 'm trying to educate you I suggest your read the following .

I think this is one area where our two sides actually agree in the general idea that it would be good to reduce the number of abortions by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies . Imagine what could be accomplished if our sides actually worked together in this direction . I think that the devil is in the details , though , in how each of our sides would work to achieve this . So , what are your views on how best to decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies and why do you hold those views ? Do you advocate teaching abstinence only ? Teaching proper contraceptive use in school ? Other ideas ?""","""I think you should teach everything about pregnancy and sex . The problem comes in when no one takes your seriously . Abortion allows for a no consequence view on sex . It 's like teaching the dangers of steroids in baseball yet the consequence is to take a 1 day class on substantive abuse if you get caught . Of course the rewards are much better . Same thing with attitude towards sex .

The 2nd Amendment , ratified in 1787 , refers to the National Guard , which was created 130 years later , in 1917 . 13 . The National Guard , federally funded , with bases on federal land , using federally-owned weapons , vehicles , buildings and uniforms , punishing trespassers under federal law , is a `` state `` militia . 14 . These phrases : `` right of the people peaceably to assemble , `` `` right of the people to be secure in their homes , `` `` enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people , `` and `` The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively , and to the people `` all refer to individuals , but `` the right of the people to keep and bear arm `` refers to the state . 15 . '' The Constitution is strong and will never change. `` But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd , 4th , and 5th Amendments to that Constitution . 16 . Rifles and handguns are n't necessary to national defense ! Of course , the army has hundreds of thousands of them . 17 . Private citizens should n't have handguns , because they are n't `` military weapons `` , but private citizens should n't have `` assault rifles `` , because they are military weapons . 18 . In spite of waiting periods , background checks , finger printing , government forms , etc. , guns today are too readily available , which is responsible for recent school shootings . In the 1940 's , 1950 's and1960 's , anyone could buy guns at hardware stores , army surplus stores , gas stations , variety stores , Sears mail order , no waiting , no background check , no fingerprints , no government forms and there were no school shootings . 19 . The NRA 's attempt to run a `` do n't touch `` campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda , but the anti-gun lobby 's attempt to run a `` do n't touch `` campaign is responsible social activity . 20 . Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly , and so simple to use that they make murder easy . 21 . A handgun , with up to 4 controls , is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use , as opposed to an automobile that only has 20 . 22 . Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is `` an accident waiting to happen `` and gun makers ' advertisements aimed at women are `` preying on their fears. `` 23 . Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed . 24 . Guns cause violence , which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows . 25 . A majority of the population supports gun control , just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves . 26 . Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a `` weapon of mass destruction `` or an `` assault weapon. `` 27 . Most people ca n't be trusted , so we should have laws against guns , which most people will abide by because they can be trusted . 28 . The right of Internet pornographers to exist can not be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights , but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights . 29 . Free speech entitles one to own newspapers , transmitters , computers , and typewriters , but self-defense only justifies bare hands . 30 . The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution , and the NRA is bad , because it defends other parts of the Constitution . 31 . Charlton Heston , a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored , but Michael Douglas , a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control , Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit . 32 . Police operate with backup within groups , which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do `` civilians `` who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition . 33 . We should ban `` Saturday Night Specials `` and other inexpensive guns because it 's not fair that poor people have access to guns too . 34 . Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain . 35 . Private citizens do n't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection . 36 . Citizens do n't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs , who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops , need a gun . 37 . '' Assault weapons `` have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people . The police need assault weapons . You do not . 38 . When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion , that 's bad ; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & amp ; Wesson , that 's good . 39 . Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes , which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon . 40 . Handgun Control , Inc. says they want to `` keep guns out of the wrong hands. `` Guess what ? You have the wrong hands""",DISAGREE,"""But this is a bogus""","""you seem unable to make a logical point so you resort to attacking the individual"""

Unloaded rifle on TV triggers controversy - English OTSU , Shiga Prefecture -- Given this nation 's strict gun control law , were police overreacting when they swooped on a TV broadcaster that had allowed a celebrity to handle a hunting rifle during a live broadcast ? The Shiga prefectural police insist they were perfectly within their rights , but TV networks are outraged , citing the fact the weapon was not loaded . The incident stems from a show aired Jan. 17 by Biwako Broadcasting Co . Almost four months later , police mounted a search of the premises and confiscated a dozen items , including a script and a DVD of the show . Critics accuse the police of being overzealous and question their motives , but law enforcement officials remain unrepentant . Shiga prefectural police regard the incident , in which a hunter with a gun permit allowed TV personality Noburo Harada , 57 , to momentarily handle the rifle during the show , as a serious breach of a law concerning the storage and management of firearms . So much so , in fact , that on June 12 , the prefectural police referred the case to prosecutors . As a result , the hunter , aged 49 , along with a 60-year-old TV producer and a 37-year-old director of the show , could face charges of violating the swords and firearms control law . Police did not pursue a case against Harada even though he briefly handled the weapon . Police argued that he did not actually `` possess `` the rifle because the hunter handed it to him in an unscripted moment during the broadcast . Police justified their search on grounds that they needed to determine if the law concerning the storage and management of firearms had been broken . The show , called `` Tokimeki Shiga 'S , `` is broadcast one Saturday a month . In the show , Harada visits various locations in the prefecture as a travel guide . The program in question was set in Yogo , where Harada and other cast members were served a pot of wild boar meat . The hunter who had killed the boar appeared in the scene . He offered the unloaded weapon to Harada and asked , `` Do you want to hold it ? `` Harada held the rifle and commented , `` It 's heavy , is n't it ? `` adding , `` Not everybody has a chance to hold it , right ? `` He held the firearm for six seconds and then gave it back . Biwako Broadcasting says the scene in which the hunter handed over the rifle was not in the script and was improvised . The TV crew decided to display the rifle on the show after the hunter told the director he had no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting . The prefectural police began their investigation after a complaint by a viewer . The intervention by the police flabbergasted Harada and employees of other TV stations . '' I never could have imagined anything like this , `` Harada , a former member of the male comedy duo Anonenone , told reporters after he was questioned by police on June 2 . '' I was stunned. `` Akihiko Ito , head of the TV station 's programming department , said the station would cooperate with police , but defended Harada 's actions . '' We consulted our lawyers , and it is hard to believe that touching a rifle for about six seconds is equivalent to possessing it , `` he said . A spokesperson with a TV station based in Osaka sharply criticized police . '' They should have at least asked ( Biwako Broadcasting ) to cooperate voluntarily , `` a spokesperson said . '' From a common sense standpoint , we can not even comprehend what the police were thinking. `` An employee at another TV station was also critical . '' If we , for example , were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife , would the police investigate us , too ? `` the employee asked . '' Such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs . This would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming. `` But police say they do n't understand what all the fuss is about . They say the media has , by focusing on the celebrity angle , blurred the facts in the case . A senior official with the Shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that Harada briefly held the rifle , but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of `` storage and management. `` An explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law , which took effect in January . The law was tightened after a 37-year-old man in Sasebo , Nagasaki Prefecture , shot and killed two people and wounded six in December 2007 . The man , known for erratic behavior , committed suicide after the shooting . The incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate . '' I believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the TV crew lacked an awareness of the firearm 's potential danger , `` another police official said . According to the National Police Agency , police can file a case against anybody if he or she , with criminal intent to kill or injure people , possesses a weapon for even a second . A case can be built based not on the length of time of possession , but on the purpose of possession , the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner . The Shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show . By transporting the gun to the show , the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit , police asserted . They defended questioning Harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue -- did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon ? Takaaki Hattori , professor of media law at Rikkyo University in Tokyo , says that police went too far . '' The way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing . I sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law , `` he said . '' They should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities. `` But he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent . '' The TV station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show . The gun owner may have been primarily responsible , but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law. `` Takaaki Matsumiya , professor of criminal law at Ritsumeikan University School of Law in Kyoto , disagrees that the TV station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities . Citing a precedent set by the Tokyo High Court in June 1967 , he said : `` The high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute 'possession , ' `` he said . '' There have been no precedents to alter that interpretation . Harada did not 'possess ' it ( during the show ) . `` Matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set . '' When the precedent concludes that a person 'has no legitimate reason ' for bearing and carrying a firearm , it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm , `` he said .

A spokesperson with a TV station based in Osaka sharply criticized police . '' They should have at least asked ( Biwako Broadcasting ) to cooperate voluntarily , `` a spokesperson said . '' From a common sense standpoint , we can not even comprehend what the police were thinking. `` An employee at another TV station was also critical . '' If we , for example , were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife , would the police investigate us , too ? `` the employee asked . '' Such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs . This would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming. `` But police say they do n't understand what all the fuss is about . They say the media has , by focusing on the celebrity angle , blurred the facts in the case . A senior official with the Shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that Harada briefly held the rifle , but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of `` storage and management. `` An explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law , which took effect in January . The law was tightened after a 37-year-old man in Sasebo , Nagasaki Prefecture , shot and killed two people and wounded six in December 2007 . The man , known for erratic behavior , committed suicide after the shooting . The incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate . '' I believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the TV crew lacked an awareness of the firearm 's potential danger , `` another police official said . According to the National Police Agency , police can file a case against anybody if he or she , with criminal intent to kill or injure people , possesses a weapon for even a second . A case can be built based not on the length of time of possession , but on the purpose of possession , the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner . The Shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show . By transporting the gun to the show , the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit , police asserted . They defended questioning Harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue -- did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon ? Takaaki Hattori , professor of media law at Rikkyo University in Tokyo , says that police went too far . '' The way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing . I sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law , `` he said . '' They should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities. `` But he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent . '' The TV station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show . The gun owner may have been primarily responsible , but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law. `` Takaaki Matsumiya , professor of criminal law at Ritsumeikan University School of Law in Kyoto , disagrees that the TV station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities . Citing a precedent set by the Tokyo High Court in June 1967 , he said : `` The high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute 'possession , ' `` he said . '' There have been no precedents to alter that interpretation . Harada did not 'possess ' it ( during the show ) . `` Matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set . '' When the precedent concludes that a person 'has no legitimate reason ' for bearing and carrying a firearm , it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm , `` he said . '' It is obvious that was not the case under these circumstances . '' ( IHT/Asahi : July 2,2009 ) Now then , what 's all this bull * * * * about how other industrialized nations are better off with regard to guns when compared to America ? I do n't see such being the case , do you ? If you ca n't even touch a gun that somebody hands you to examine without breaking the law , that is a serious violation of human rights and everything else . How can Japan be so much better off than we are , if it 's a crime for somebody to hand you a rifle to look at but not to keep ; especially when it 's unloaded ! ?""","""A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way .""",AGREE,"""I do n't see such being the case , do you ?

Out of HUNDREDS of people I 've talked to , it 's only a `` handful of times `` . Suppose Democrats do pick up the gay banner hard and heavy . Full gusto . What 's the effect ? I seriously expect minimal . This is going to be a battle over time . Gays got sodomy laws overturned , and the reaction was anti-gay marriage laws and amendments . The SIMPLEST thing , that should have been the most obvious to everyone , of sodomy laws overturned got a `` anti-gay marriage law/amendment `` reaction . These fights ARE BEING picked and chosen . ROFLMAO ! No . We fundamentally disagree there . How long have you been arguing the gay marriage issue . And you state that you SUPPORT equality on every issue with only the gay marriage hold-out , right ? If YOUR mind ca n't be changed in all that time , why do you think that we could win over the nation just by having Democrats come out hot and heavy . Furthermore , THINK about it . HOW LONG have we been pushing for ENDA ... And we just tried the vote , and it failed ... EVEN ON THE ISSUE THAT HAS OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SUPPORT , the anti-gays are able to stop the win . What do you think will happen on an issue we DO NOT have majority support on ?""","""Well , all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action , and IS as bad in terms of anything current . Either way you do n't have gay marriage . You have a majority in Congress right now , and you 're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash ? Yeah , there would be backlash . Heck , the Civil War was the ultimate backlash , but that did n't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change , and it 's a good thing they did . It 's your gig , though , so do what you want .

3780,"""Well , I am a creationist , and I would hope I can think logically ( it 's generally a good quality for an accountant and tax attorney to have ) . The difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple . In microevolution a species is simply adapting to it 's environments . In evolution as is usually meant by the word you are talking about the formation of an entirely new creature from inorganic compounds . If this is possible I pose a few questions for you . 1 ) Why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory ? 2 ) How did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve , while others of the same species did not ? Why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now ? Why did n't all apes evolve into humans ? 3 ) One of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils . How do you know how old a fossil is ? Every evolutionist I have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in , but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it ! That 's a classical example of circular reasoning .

Mexico is a virtual arms bazaar , with fragmentation grenades from South Korea , AK-47s from China , and shoulder-fired rocket launchers from Spain , Israel and former Soviet bloc manufacturers . -- Russian crime organizations . Interpol says Russian Mafia groups such as Poldolskaya and Moscow-based Solntsevskaya are actively trafficking drugs and arms in Mexico . - South America . During the late 1990s , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) established a clandestine arms smuggling and drug trafficking partnership with the Tijuana cartel , according to the Federal Research Division report from the Library of Congress . -- Asia . According to a 2006 Amnesty International Report , China has provided arms to countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America . Chinese assault weapons and Korean explosives have been recovered in Mexico . -- The Mexican Army . More than 150,000 soldiers deserted in the last six years , according to Mexican Congressman Robert Badillo . Many took their weapons with them , including the standard issue M-16 assault rifle made in Belgium . -- Guatemala . U.S. intelligence agencies say traffickers move immigrants , stolen cars , guns and drugs , including most of America 's cocaine , along the porous Mexican-Guatemalan border . On March 27 , La Hora , a Guatemalan newspaper , reported that police seized 500 grenades and a load of AK-47s on the border . Police say the cache was transported by a Mexican drug cartel operating out of Ixcan , a border town .""","""And NOW we find out that Mexico 's overall per capita crime rate is less than countries like the UK , Canada and ours ?

6753,"""Im calling bull on this ! Most of them didnt even have guns so they couldnt be disarmed ! A more farfetched question is the hypothetical proposition of armed Jewish resistance . First , they were not commonly armed even prior to the 1928 Law . Second , Jews had seen pogroms before and had survived them , though not without suffering . They would expect that this one would , as had the past ones , eventually subside and permit a return to normalcy . Many considered themselves `` patriotic Germans `` for their service in the first World War . These simply were not people prepared to stage violent resistance . Nor were they alone in this mode of appeasement . The defiance of `` never again `` is not so much a warning to potential oppressors as it is a challenge to Jews to reject the passive response to pogrom . Third , it hardly seems conceivable that armed resistance by Jews ( or any other target group ) would have led to any weakening of Nazi rule , let alone a full scale popular rebellion ; on the contrary , it seems more likely it would have strengthened the support the Nazis already had . Their foul lies about Jewish perfidy would have been given a grain of substance . To project backward and speculate thus is to fail to learn the lesson history has so painfully provided . The simple conclusion is that there are no lessons about the efficacy of gun control to be learned from the Germany of the first half of this century . It is all too easy to forget the seductive allure that fascism presented to all the West , bogged down in economic and social morass . What must be remembered is that the Nazis were master manipulators of popular emotion and sentiment , and were disdainful of people thinking for themselves . There is the danger to which we should pay great heed .

8581,"""Brooklyn , New York ( VBS.TV ) -- On January 22 , 2006 , the New York Times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from Pakistan 's tribal areas , which has been called `` the most dangerous place in the world. `` A week before that , the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area . They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives . Instead , they killed 18 women and children . One week before that , I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel , the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas , where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns . Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible . It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar . They repeatedly denied us entry because , according to them , the Pakistani Army had too many `` sensitive operations `` going on in that region . Without my personal advantage ( a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province ) , we never would have gotten in . The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi . He was born and raised in the tribal areas . He took care of us while we were there , and he was a godsend . You ca n't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem .

8581,"""Brooklyn , New York ( VBS.TV ) -- On January 22 , 2006 , the New York Times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from Pakistan 's tribal areas , which has been called `` the most dangerous place in the world. `` A week before that , the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area . They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives . Instead , they killed 18 women and children . One week before that , I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel , the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas , where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns . Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible . It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar . They repeatedly denied us entry because , according to them , the Pakistani Army had too many `` sensitive operations `` going on in that region . Without my personal advantage ( a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province ) , we never would have gotten in . The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi . He was born and raised in the tribal areas . He took care of us while we were there , and he was a godsend . You ca n't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem .

God , on the other hand , is elusive even at the definition stage . he is sometimes defined as creator of the world , a higher force , all-powerful , greatest being possible , love , etc ... unless a definition is agreed upon , even beginning to prove existance is difficult . suppose we define God as love . love exists , therefore God exists . however , not everybody agrees to this definition . suppose we define God as creator of the universe . sciences states the the universe was created spontaneously , therefore God doesnt exist . therefore , for some , either this definition is not satisfactory or the conclusion of the scientists isnt satisfactory . finding proof for the existence of God becomes increasingly difficult when Gods definition gets constantly revised and adjusted . if we could simply agree on the definition for God then we could begin to find a proof .""",DISAGREE,"""proving the existance of the wind can not be done""","""wind exists . this has been proven"""

How about the actual scientists who reject the media promotion of this issue ? Here 's an excerpt : Climatologists Reject Media Claims of Global Warming Consensus `` [ i ] n November 2004 , German climatologist Hans von Storch , director of the GKSS Institute for Coastal Research ( IfK ) in Geesthacht , Germany , foresaw that claims of alarmist consensus would be made by nonscientists ... `` Environment & amp ; Climate News > August 2005 Environment Environment > Climate : Consensus Email a Friend Written By : Alan Caruba Published In : Environment & amp ; Climate News > August 2005 Publication date : 08/01/2005 Publisher : The Heartland Institute Leading climatologists spent the month of June fighting false proclamations from non-scientists claiming scientists have reached agreement that catastrophic global warming is occurring . Alarmists Claim Debate Over On June 1 , California Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) claimed `` the debate is over `` and global warming alarmists ' predictions had carried the day . The Natural Resources Defense Council on June 9 declared , `` The world 's leading scientists now agree that global warming is real and is happening right now . According to their forecasts , extreme changes in climate could produce a future in which erratic and chaotic weather , melting ice caps and rising sea levels usher in an era of drought , crop failure , famine , flood and mass extinctions. `` On June 13 , USA Today declared , `` The debate 's over : Globe is Warming. `` In support of its claim , the newspaper cited the positions of some left-leaning religious groups , some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources , and some politicians . Scientists Disagree While each of the above claims from non-scientists received significant media coverage , leading climatologists spent the month of June rebutting such proclamations . Atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer , professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and former director of the U.S . Weather Satellite Service , sent a letter to the editor of USA Today directly refuting its claim . '' Your editorial ... claim [ s ] the global warming debate is over . Not so , `` wrote Singer . Singer wrote , `` Sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the EPA [ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ] says . And temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree F -- not exactly a catastrophe. `` Added Singer in a subsequent letter to the Canadian media , `` Thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that Kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically . '' Even if you ignore the enormous cost of Kyoto ( estimated recently by Prof. George Taylor of Oregon State University -- see http : //www.sitewave.net/news/s49p628.htm -- at one trillion U.S. dollars a year for full implementation in OECD countries ) , climate science research is rapidly moving AWAY from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases , specifically CO2 , is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change. `` Sun Called Primary Cause `` If we just look at the historical data , there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century , `` said Myron Ebell , director of global warming and environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute . '' The impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate . This historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences. `` The controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations , according to Dr. Benny Peiser of England 's John Moore 's University , is solar ray activity . '' Six eminent researchers from the Russian Academy of Science and the Israel Space Agency have just published a startling paper in one of the world 's leading space science journals . The team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the Earth 's climate , `` Peiser was quoted as saying in the May 17 National Post . Moreover , reports Peiser , Jan Veizer , one of Canada 's top earth scientists , published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded , `` empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate , with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers. `` Added Peiser , `` In fact , the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus ' is not restricted to individual scientists . It also includes distinguished scientific organizations such as the Russian Academy of Science and the U.S. Association of State Climatologists , both of which are highly skeptical of the whole idea . '' Heartland Institute - Article And here 's more : Renowned Scientist Defects From Belief in Global Warming Â– Caps Year of Vindication for Skeptics October 17 , 2006 October 17 , 2006 Washington DC - One of the most decorated French geophysicists has converted from a believer in manmade catastrophic global warming to a climate skeptic . This latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics . Scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human-caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media-promoted scientific Â “ consensusÂ ” on climate alarmism . Claude Allegre , a former government official and an active member of FranceÂ ’ s Socialist Party , wrote an editorial on September 21 , 2006 in the French newspaper L'Express titled Â “ The Snows of KilimanjaroÂ ” ( For English Translation , click here : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming . See : http : //www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribune ... asp ? ida=451670 Allegre wrote that the Â “ cause of climate change remains unknownÂ ” and pointed out that Kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming , but to local land use and precipitation changes . Allegre also pointed out that studies show that Antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice . Â “ Following the month of August experienced by the northern half of France , the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes , Â ” Allegre wrote . He also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money , noting that Â “ the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people ! Â ” Allegre , a member of both the French and U.S. Academy of Sciences , had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming . '' By burning fossil fuels , man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century , `` Allegre wrote 20 years ago . In addition , Allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a November 18 , 1992 letter titled Â “ World Scientists ' Warning to HumanityÂ ” in which the scientists warned that global warmingÂ ’ s Â “ potential risks are very great.Â ” See : Warning to Humanity Allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles , written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the Goldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States . Allegre 's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a Â “ consensusÂ ” about manmade global warming . Proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently . An environmental magazine in September called for Nuremberg-style trials for global warming skeptics and CBS News Â “ 60 MinutesÂ ” correspondent Scott Pelley compared skeptics to Â “ Holocaust deniers.Â ” See : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works & amp ; Scott Pelley And Catherine Herrick On Global Warming Coverage - Public Eye In addition , former Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as `` global warming deniers. `` This increase in rhetorical flourish comes at a time when new climate science research continues to unravel the global warming alarmistsÂ ’ computer model predictions of future climatic doom and vindicate skeptics . 60 Scientists Debunk Global Warming Fears Earlier this year , a group of prominent scientists came forward to question the so-called Â “ consensusÂ ” that the Earth faces a Â “ climate emergency.Â ” On April 6 , 2006 , 60 scientists wrote a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists . Â “ Observational evidence does not support today 's computer climate models , so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the futureÂ…Significant [ scientific ] advances have been made since the [ Kyoto ] protocol was created , many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases . If , back in the mid-1990s , we knew what we know today about climate , Kyoto would almost certainly not exist , because we would have concluded it was not necessary , Â ” the 60 scientists wrote . See : Open Kyoto to debate Â “ It was only 30 years ago that many of today 's global-warming alarmists were telling us that the world was in the midst of a global-cooling catastrophe . But the science continued to evolve , and still does , even though so many choose to ignore it when it does not fit with predetermined political agendas , Â ” the 60 scientists concluded .. : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works : : Press Room : . So in conclusion , as the alleged science of evolution is based solely on pre-determined assumptions , so is the myth of Global Warming .""",DISAGREE,"""Are you an acolyte of McIntyre and McKitrick""","""How about the actual scientists who reject the media promotion of this issue ?"""

9862,"""It 's not a difficult challange .""","""No , it was n't . Given the number of scientists one might assume that at least one would confuse his science with his religion . It seems that according to AIG , 182 actually do . I really have to commend AIG in that they did not list `` Dr. `` Kent Hovind , `` Dr. `` Carl Baugh , `` Dr. `` Don Patton . However , the AIG does list Thomas Barnes who 's highest earned degree is an MS in physics , his Sc.D being honorary from his undergraduate , Christian university . Clifford Burdick has a `` degree `` from a non-university ( as described in the mimeographed bulletin of the `` University of Physical Sciences `` , from which Burdick claimed his degree : `` 'The University is not an educational institution , but a society of individuals of common interest for the advancement of physical science . There are no campus , professors or tuition fee . '' ) . Harold Slusher has an honorary degree from a Bible college with only a 1/2 man graduate science department in addition to his `` degree `` from Columbia Pacific University a non-accredited correspondence school that promises a degree in less than a year . I do note that Clifford Burdick is listed on list of deceased scientists who believed in a creator . I presume that the rest of the `` scientists `` listed by AIG actually have the PhDs that AIG claims of all 182 listed . I invite you to compare that list to the Steve list , now at 720+ scientists named Steve who accept evolution as the correct explanation for the observed diversity of life . The name `` Steve `` ( and variations thereof ) comprises about 1 % of the population . The percentage of qualified scientists with that name can not be far from the norm . The Steve list was initially composed of scientists with PhD degrees biology , geology , paleontology , or a related scientific field . However , there are also scientists in fields such as cosmology and astrophysics that are signatories as well as other fields with an interest in evolutionary theory . For example , Stephen Hawking has signed the Steve list . I invite you to find bogus and inappropriate degrees on the Steve list . I am sure that the NCSE would be appreciative of your efforts . Hopefully you will have a more difficult time than I did in identifying bogus degrees . Oh , yes . In my experience , creationist scientists were always creationist long before they were scientists . On the other hand , there are lots of scientists who were once creationists , before they became scientists . As many polls have shown , the more educated a person becomes , the less likely it is that he/she is a creationist .""",AGREE,"""It 's not a difficult .""","""No , it was n't ."""
