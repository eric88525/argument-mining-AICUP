Any religion that worships nature , with no defined god , is n't really at odds with atheism , is it ? Your phrase within parenthesis , Â “ without the influence of GodÂ ” , points out ( to me ) that discussions about God on these forums , and even throughout Christian study and discussion , are all too often about only his presence or absence , nothing more . There is something more , and that something is Satan , the Â “ great deceiverÂ ” , the Â “ evil oneÂ ” . In DatabedÂ ’ s hypothetical , where he said Â “ stuck them on a planet with no access to any knowledge of God or ChristÂ ” , my belief is that God/Christ would be there , ( omnipresent ) but I wasnÂ ’ t really consciously thinking about the possibility of the evil one NOT being there . I believe itÂ ’ s SatanÂ ’ s presence that causes atheism and it also causes false religions to be dreamed up . So to clarify my answer to his question , for people on another planet Â “ with no access to any knowledge of God or ChristÂ ” would become a blend of atheism and false religion , since Satan is the author of both . To me as a Â “ fundamentalÂ ” Christian , there is little difference between the two .""",DISAGREE,"""If you believe that a planet populated solely by atheists would remain solely atheist ( without the influence of God ) , on what basis do you explain the many other religions that exist on Earth ?""","""So to clarify my answer to his question , for people on another planet Â with no access to any knowledge of God or ChristÂ would become a blend of atheism and false religion , since Satan is the author of both ."""

1647,"""Narcotics traffickers are acquiring firepower more appropriate to an army -- including grenade launchers and antitank rockets -- and the police are feeling outgunned . Reporting from Zihuatanejo , Mexico , and Mexico City -- It was a brazen assault , not just because it targeted the city 's police station , but for the choice of weapon : grenades . The Feb. 21 attack on police headquarters in coastal Zihuatanejo , which injured four people , fit a disturbing trend of Mexico 's drug wars . Traffickers have escalated their arms race , acquiring military-grade weapons , including hand grenades , grenade launchers , armor-piercing munitions and antitank rockets with firepower far beyond the assault rifles and pistols that have dominated their arsenals . Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea , eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semiauto- matic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas , New Mexico , Arizona and California . The proliferation of heavier armaments points to a menacing new stage in the Mexican government 's 2-year-old war against drug organizations , which are evolving into a more militarized force prepared to take on Mexican army troops , deployed by the thousands , as well as to attack each other . These groups appear to be taking advantage of a robust global black market and porous borders , especially between Mexico and Guatemala . Some of the weapons are left over from the wars that the United States helped fight in Central America , U.S. officials said . '' There is an arms race between the cartels , `` said Alberto Islas , a security consultant who advises the Mexican government . '' One group gets rocket-propelled grenades , the other has to have them. `` There are even more ominous developments : Authorities reported three thefts of several hundred pounds of blasting material from industrial explosives plants in Durango during a four-day period last month . Authorities believe the material may have been destined for car bombs or remotely detonated roadside devices , which have been used with devastating effect in Iraq , killing more than 1,822 members of U.S.-led forces since the war there began nearly six years ago . The Mexican army has recovered most of the material , and there has been no reported use of such devices . Grenades or military-grade weapons have been reported in at least 10 Mexican states during the last six months , used against police headquarters , city halls , a U.S. consulate , TV stations and senior Mexican officials . In a three-week period ended March 6 , five grenade attacks were launched on police patrols and stations and the home of a commander in the south-central state of Michoacan . Other such attacks occurred in five other states during the same period . At least one grenade attack north of the border , at a Texas nightclub frequented by U.S. police officers , has been tied to Mexican traffickers . How many weapons have been smuggled into Mexico from Central America is not known , and the military-grade munitions are still a small fraction of the larger arsenal in the hands of narcotics traffickers . Mexican officials continue to push Washington to stem the well-documented flow of conventional weapons from the United States , as Congress holds hearings on the role those smuggled guns play in arming Mexican drug cartels . There is no comprehensive data on how many people have been killed by heavier weapons . But four days after the assault on the Zihuatanejo police station , four of the city 's officers were slain in a highway ambush six miles from town on the road to Acapulco . In addition to the standard AK-47 and AR-15 assault rifles , the attackers fired at least six .50-caliber shells into the officers ' pickup . The vehicle blew up when hit by what experts believe was a grenade or explosive projectile . The bodies of the officers were charred . '' These are really weapons of war , `` said Alberto Fernandez , spokesman for the Zihuatanejo city government . '' We only know these devices from war movies. `` U.S. law enforcement officials say they detected the smuggling of grenades and other military-grade equipment into Mexico about a year and a half ago , and observed a sharp uptick in the use of the weapons about six months ago . The Mexican government said it has seized 2,239 grenades in the last two years , in contrast to 59 seized over the previous two years . The enhanced weaponry represents a wide sampling from the international arms bazaar , with grenades and launchers produced by U.S. , South Korean , Israeli , Spanish or former Soviet bloc manufacturers . Many had been sold legally to governments , including Mexico 's , and then were diverted onto the black market . Some may be sold directly to the traffickers by corrupt elements of national armies , authorities and experts say . The single deadliest attack on civilians by drug traffickers in Mexico took place Sept. 15 at an Independence Day celebration in the central plaza of Morelia , hometown of President Felipe Calderon and capital of Michoacan . Attackers hurled fragmentation grenades at the celebrating crowd , killing eight people and wounding dozens more . Amid the recent spate of attacks in Michoacan , federal police on Feb. 20 announced the discovery of 66 fragmentation grenades in the fake bottom of a truck intercepted in southern Mexico , just over the border from Guatemala . The two men arrested with the cargo told police they were transporting the grenades to Morelia . Grenades used in three attacks in Monterrey and Texas were linked to a single Monterrey warehouse , packed with explosives and high-caliber guns , reportedly belonging to the Gulf cartel . Mexican authorities raided the warehouse in October and seized the cache , which contained South Korean-manufactured grenades similar to the American M67 fragmentation grenade . Grenades from the same lot were used in a Jan. 6 attack on the Televisa television station in Monterrey , which caused damage but no injuries , and during an Oct. 12 attack against the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey . The device at the consulate did not detonate . Late on the night of Jan. 31 , a Saturday , a man tossed a grenade into the El Booty Lounge in Pharr , Texas . Three off-duty Texas police officers were there , though authorities would not say whether they were the target . The explosive , which did not detonate , was traced to the Monterrey warehouse . Traffickers using M203 40-millimeter grenade launchers last year attacked and killed eight Mexican federal police officers in Culiacan , the capital of Sinaloa state . In the northern border city of Nogales , the Sonora state police commander was killed Nov. 2 in an ambush by purported traffickers firing AK-47s and lobbing grenades . He had been returning from a meeting with U.S. authorities in Arizona to discuss gun smuggling . In the western state of Durango , three people , including a 3-year-old child , were killed in a grenade attack in January . The firepower has gone beyond grenades . Armed with light antitank weapons , would-be assassins went after the nation 's top counternarcotics prosecutor in December 2007 . The assailants were intercepted before they reached Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos , who was not hurt . The weapons seized were linked to the notorious Sinaloa cartel . '' They were betting on being able to escalate with a spectacular strike precisely to terrify society , `` Santiago Vasconcelos said at the time . ( He was killed in November in a plane crash . ) Beyond the weaponry , drug gangs for several years have demonstrated the ability to form squads and employ military tactics , including the use of assault rifles , hand grenades , grenade launchers and fully automatic weapons to pin down army forces . This has enabled them to attack army patrols frontally , as they did with lethal results Feb. 7 in the central state of Zacatecas , killing one sergeant and critically wounding a colonel .

1647,"""Narcotics traffickers are acquiring firepower more appropriate to an army -- including grenade launchers and antitank rockets -- and the police are feeling outgunned . Reporting from Zihuatanejo , Mexico , and Mexico City -- It was a brazen assault , not just because it targeted the city 's police station , but for the choice of weapon : grenades . The Feb. 21 attack on police headquarters in coastal Zihuatanejo , which injured four people , fit a disturbing trend of Mexico 's drug wars . Traffickers have escalated their arms race , acquiring military-grade weapons , including hand grenades , grenade launchers , armor-piercing munitions and antitank rockets with firepower far beyond the assault rifles and pistols that have dominated their arsenals . Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea , eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semiauto- matic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas , New Mexico , Arizona and California . The proliferation of heavier armaments points to a menacing new stage in the Mexican government 's 2-year-old war against drug organizations , which are evolving into a more militarized force prepared to take on Mexican army troops , deployed by the thousands , as well as to attack each other . These groups appear to be taking advantage of a robust global black market and porous borders , especially between Mexico and Guatemala . Some of the weapons are left over from the wars that the United States helped fight in Central America , U.S. officials said . '' There is an arms race between the cartels , `` said Alberto Islas , a security consultant who advises the Mexican government . '' One group gets rocket-propelled grenades , the other has to have them. `` There are even more ominous developments : Authorities reported three thefts of several hundred pounds of blasting material from industrial explosives plants in Durango during a four-day period last month . Authorities believe the material may have been destined for car bombs or remotely detonated roadside devices , which have been used with devastating effect in Iraq , killing more than 1,822 members of U.S.-led forces since the war there began nearly six years ago . The Mexican army has recovered most of the material , and there has been no reported use of such devices . Grenades or military-grade weapons have been reported in at least 10 Mexican states during the last six months , used against police headquarters , city halls , a U.S. consulate , TV stations and senior Mexican officials . In a three-week period ended March 6 , five grenade attacks were launched on police patrols and stations and the home of a commander in the south-central state of Michoacan . Other such attacks occurred in five other states during the same period . At least one grenade attack north of the border , at a Texas nightclub frequented by U.S. police officers , has been tied to Mexican traffickers . How many weapons have been smuggled into Mexico from Central America is not known , and the military-grade munitions are still a small fraction of the larger arsenal in the hands of narcotics traffickers . Mexican officials continue to push Washington to stem the well-documented flow of conventional weapons from the United States , as Congress holds hearings on the role those smuggled guns play in arming Mexican drug cartels . There is no comprehensive data on how many people have been killed by heavier weapons . But four days after the assault on the Zihuatanejo police station , four of the city 's officers were slain in a highway ambush six miles from town on the road to Acapulco . In addition to the standard AK-47 and AR-15 assault rifles , the attackers fired at least six .50-caliber shells into the officers ' pickup . The vehicle blew up when hit by what experts believe was a grenade or explosive projectile . The bodies of the officers were charred . '' These are really weapons of war , `` said Alberto Fernandez , spokesman for the Zihuatanejo city government . '' We only know these devices from war movies. `` U.S. law enforcement officials say they detected the smuggling of grenades and other military-grade equipment into Mexico about a year and a half ago , and observed a sharp uptick in the use of the weapons about six months ago . The Mexican government said it has seized 2,239 grenades in the last two years , in contrast to 59 seized over the previous two years . The enhanced weaponry represents a wide sampling from the international arms bazaar , with grenades and launchers produced by U.S. , South Korean , Israeli , Spanish or former Soviet bloc manufacturers . Many had been sold legally to governments , including Mexico 's , and then were diverted onto the black market . Some may be sold directly to the traffickers by corrupt elements of national armies , authorities and experts say . The single deadliest attack on civilians by drug traffickers in Mexico took place Sept. 15 at an Independence Day celebration in the central plaza of Morelia , hometown of President Felipe Calderon and capital of Michoacan . Attackers hurled fragmentation grenades at the celebrating crowd , killing eight people and wounding dozens more . Amid the recent spate of attacks in Michoacan , federal police on Feb. 20 announced the discovery of 66 fragmentation grenades in the fake bottom of a truck intercepted in southern Mexico , just over the border from Guatemala . The two men arrested with the cargo told police they were transporting the grenades to Morelia . Grenades used in three attacks in Monterrey and Texas were linked to a single Monterrey warehouse , packed with explosives and high-caliber guns , reportedly belonging to the Gulf cartel . Mexican authorities raided the warehouse in October and seized the cache , which contained South Korean-manufactured grenades similar to the American M67 fragmentation grenade . Grenades from the same lot were used in a Jan. 6 attack on the Televisa television station in Monterrey , which caused damage but no injuries , and during an Oct. 12 attack against the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey . The device at the consulate did not detonate . Late on the night of Jan. 31 , a Saturday , a man tossed a grenade into the El Booty Lounge in Pharr , Texas . Three off-duty Texas police officers were there , though authorities would not say whether they were the target . The explosive , which did not detonate , was traced to the Monterrey warehouse . Traffickers using M203 40-millimeter grenade launchers last year attacked and killed eight Mexican federal police officers in Culiacan , the capital of Sinaloa state . In the northern border city of Nogales , the Sonora state police commander was killed Nov. 2 in an ambush by purported traffickers firing AK-47s and lobbing grenades . He had been returning from a meeting with U.S. authorities in Arizona to discuss gun smuggling . In the western state of Durango , three people , including a 3-year-old child , were killed in a grenade attack in January . The firepower has gone beyond grenades . Armed with light antitank weapons , would-be assassins went after the nation 's top counternarcotics prosecutor in December 2007 . The assailants were intercepted before they reached Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos , who was not hurt . The weapons seized were linked to the notorious Sinaloa cartel . '' They were betting on being able to escalate with a spectacular strike precisely to terrify society , `` Santiago Vasconcelos said at the time . ( He was killed in November in a plane crash . ) Beyond the weaponry , drug gangs for several years have demonstrated the ability to form squads and employ military tactics , including the use of assault rifles , hand grenades , grenade launchers and fully automatic weapons to pin down army forces . This has enabled them to attack army patrols frontally , as they did with lethal results Feb. 7 in the central state of Zacatecas , killing one sergeant and critically wounding a colonel . '' At this stage , the drug cartels are using basic infantry weaponry to counter government forces , `` a U.S. government official in Mexico said .

1647,"""Narcotics traffickers are acquiring firepower more appropriate to an army -- including grenade launchers and antitank rockets -- and the police are feeling outgunned . Reporting from Zihuatanejo , Mexico , and Mexico City -- It was a brazen assault , not just because it targeted the city 's police station , but for the choice of weapon : grenades . The Feb. 21 attack on police headquarters in coastal Zihuatanejo , which injured four people , fit a disturbing trend of Mexico 's drug wars . Traffickers have escalated their arms race , acquiring military-grade weapons , including hand grenades , grenade launchers , armor-piercing munitions and antitank rockets with firepower far beyond the assault rifles and pistols that have dominated their arsenals . Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea , eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semiauto- matic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas , New Mexico , Arizona and California . The proliferation of heavier armaments points to a menacing new stage in the Mexican government 's 2-year-old war against drug organizations , which are evolving into a more militarized force prepared to take on Mexican army troops , deployed by the thousands , as well as to attack each other . These groups appear to be taking advantage of a robust global black market and porous borders , especially between Mexico and Guatemala . Some of the weapons are left over from the wars that the United States helped fight in Central America , U.S. officials said . '' There is an arms race between the cartels , `` said Alberto Islas , a security consultant who advises the Mexican government . '' One group gets rocket-propelled grenades , the other has to have them. `` There are even more ominous developments : Authorities reported three thefts of several hundred pounds of blasting material from industrial explosives plants in Durango during a four-day period last month . Authorities believe the material may have been destined for car bombs or remotely detonated roadside devices , which have been used with devastating effect in Iraq , killing more than 1,822 members of U.S.-led forces since the war there began nearly six years ago . The Mexican army has recovered most of the material , and there has been no reported use of such devices . Grenades or military-grade weapons have been reported in at least 10 Mexican states during the last six months , used against police headquarters , city halls , a U.S. consulate , TV stations and senior Mexican officials . In a three-week period ended March 6 , five grenade attacks were launched on police patrols and stations and the home of a commander in the south-central state of Michoacan . Other such attacks occurred in five other states during the same period . At least one grenade attack north of the border , at a Texas nightclub frequented by U.S. police officers , has been tied to Mexican traffickers . How many weapons have been smuggled into Mexico from Central America is not known , and the military-grade munitions are still a small fraction of the larger arsenal in the hands of narcotics traffickers . Mexican officials continue to push Washington to stem the well-documented flow of conventional weapons from the United States , as Congress holds hearings on the role those smuggled guns play in arming Mexican drug cartels . There is no comprehensive data on how many people have been killed by heavier weapons . But four days after the assault on the Zihuatanejo police station , four of the city 's officers were slain in a highway ambush six miles from town on the road to Acapulco . In addition to the standard AK-47 and AR-15 assault rifles , the attackers fired at least six .50-caliber shells into the officers ' pickup . The vehicle blew up when hit by what experts believe was a grenade or explosive projectile . The bodies of the officers were charred . '' These are really weapons of war , `` said Alberto Fernandez , spokesman for the Zihuatanejo city government . '' We only know these devices from war movies. `` U.S. law enforcement officials say they detected the smuggling of grenades and other military-grade equipment into Mexico about a year and a half ago , and observed a sharp uptick in the use of the weapons about six months ago . The Mexican government said it has seized 2,239 grenades in the last two years , in contrast to 59 seized over the previous two years . The enhanced weaponry represents a wide sampling from the international arms bazaar , with grenades and launchers produced by U.S. , South Korean , Israeli , Spanish or former Soviet bloc manufacturers . Many had been sold legally to governments , including Mexico 's , and then were diverted onto the black market . Some may be sold directly to the traffickers by corrupt elements of national armies , authorities and experts say . The single deadliest attack on civilians by drug traffickers in Mexico took place Sept. 15 at an Independence Day celebration in the central plaza of Morelia , hometown of President Felipe Calderon and capital of Michoacan . Attackers hurled fragmentation grenades at the celebrating crowd , killing eight people and wounding dozens more . Amid the recent spate of attacks in Michoacan , federal police on Feb. 20 announced the discovery of 66 fragmentation grenades in the fake bottom of a truck intercepted in southern Mexico , just over the border from Guatemala . The two men arrested with the cargo told police they were transporting the grenades to Morelia . Grenades used in three attacks in Monterrey and Texas were linked to a single Monterrey warehouse , packed with explosives and high-caliber guns , reportedly belonging to the Gulf cartel . Mexican authorities raided the warehouse in October and seized the cache , which contained South Korean-manufactured grenades similar to the American M67 fragmentation grenade . Grenades from the same lot were used in a Jan. 6 attack on the Televisa television station in Monterrey , which caused damage but no injuries , and during an Oct. 12 attack against the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey . The device at the consulate did not detonate . Late on the night of Jan. 31 , a Saturday , a man tossed a grenade into the El Booty Lounge in Pharr , Texas . Three off-duty Texas police officers were there , though authorities would not say whether they were the target . The explosive , which did not detonate , was traced to the Monterrey warehouse . Traffickers using M203 40-millimeter grenade launchers last year attacked and killed eight Mexican federal police officers in Culiacan , the capital of Sinaloa state . In the northern border city of Nogales , the Sonora state police commander was killed Nov. 2 in an ambush by purported traffickers firing AK-47s and lobbing grenades . He had been returning from a meeting with U.S. authorities in Arizona to discuss gun smuggling . In the western state of Durango , three people , including a 3-year-old child , were killed in a grenade attack in January . The firepower has gone beyond grenades . Armed with light antitank weapons , would-be assassins went after the nation 's top counternarcotics prosecutor in December 2007 . The assailants were intercepted before they reached Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos , who was not hurt . The weapons seized were linked to the notorious Sinaloa cartel . '' They were betting on being able to escalate with a spectacular strike precisely to terrify society , `` Santiago Vasconcelos said at the time . ( He was killed in November in a plane crash . ) Beyond the weaponry , drug gangs for several years have demonstrated the ability to form squads and employ military tactics , including the use of assault rifles , hand grenades , grenade launchers and fully automatic weapons to pin down army forces . This has enabled them to attack army patrols frontally , as they did with lethal results Feb. 7 in the central state of Zacatecas , killing one sergeant and critically wounding a colonel . '' At this stage , the drug cartels are using basic infantry weaponry to counter government forces , `` a U.S. government official in Mexico said . '' Encountering criminals with this kind of weaponry is a horse of a different color , `` the official said . '' It 's not your typical patrol stop , where someone pulls a gun . This has all the makings of an infantry squad , or guerrilla fighting. `` The fear of guerrilla warfare was compounded in February when 270 pounds of dynamite and several hundred electric detonators were stolen from a U.S. firm in the state of Durango . On Valentine 's Day , about 20 masked gunmen , led by a heavyset man wearing gold rings and chains , stormed the warehouse of a subsidiary of Austin Powder Co. , an industrial explosives manufacturer , according to official accounts . They overpowered guards and emptied the warehouse . Two similar thefts were reported within four days in the same area . Although the Mexican army recovered most of the dynamite , the incident augurs an even bloodier trend , officials said . '' There is only one reason to have bulk explosives , `` said Thomas G. Mangan , spokesman in Phoenix for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives . '' An improvised explosive device . A car bomb. `` In addition to grenades , high-powered guns such as the .50-caliber Barrett sniper rifle have become a weapon of choice in narcotics traffickers ' arsenals , Mangan said . Unlike grenades and antitank weapons , the .50-caliber guns can be obtained by ordinary citizens in the U.S. and smuggled easily into Mexico , like the tons of assault rifles and automatic pistols . Mexican law enforcement , such as the police in Zihuatanejo , is grossly outgunned . Officers have protested , seeking better protective gear , weaponry and pay .

Michael Ruse and Bradley Monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject . Religious authors , practically too many to name . William Dembski , David Berlinski , Phillip Johnson , Cornelius Hunter , many others . You would do well to read anything by any of these people . Far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists , like Richard Dawkins . He & # 8217 ; s become a celebrity , and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way , without fear of discrimination , academic or otherwise . Michael Behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it , not in avoiding discrimination , but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it . Read & # 8220 ; The Edge of Evolution & # 8221 ; , or & # 8220 ; Darwin & # 8217 ; s Black Box & # 8221 ; sometime .""","""Oh yes , Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant .

3021,"""Thank you Lurch . You have gotten to my point : Evolution ( as taught in modern public school textbooks ) is a religion , not a scientific fact ( as claimed by sarablaze ) .""","""So what you are saying is that even though you claimed to have studied evolution , you have not . I understand . In fact , my religion is not evolution . I even hold my religion in higher regard than to consider using it as an insult . Since you think that calling science a religion is an insult , your religion must be trivial and largely meaningless . But that aside , since you want to lump all of science into the word `` evolution `` so that you can reject it all at once , I 'm just going to use the word science . sarablaze is n't a scientist and , like you , has probably had very little scientific education . But I 'm going to try to explain to you again . A religion is held by faith . That means that it is not supported by actual evidence . On the other hand , science is not accepted by faith since it is built on a process of questioning and testing everything . There is nothing in science that I `` believe `` . Do I believe that the earth orbits the sun ? No . But when presented with the observations of the relative positions of the sun and planets , the most parsimonious explanation is that it is so . I accept that and will accept that until someone can present more evidence and a better explanation . That is true of all science . I do n't believe any of it but accept the explanations that have been tested that account for the observations . In science , by the way , the facts are the observations - not the theories . So the facts of gravity are the observations of things falling to earth and observations of the relative positions of the planets . The current theory of gravity only imperfectly explains those facts - it is part of the general theory of relativity developed by Einstein . In biology , the facts are that we observe living things to change over time . We even have facts from many different fields ( biogeography , genetics , molecular biology , population genetics , morphology , embryology , paleontology , and others ) that point to the fact that living things change over time . The explanations of the mechanics of those changes form the theory of evolution .""",DISAGREE,"""Evolution ( as taught in modern public school textbooks ) is a religion , not a scientific fact""","""what you are saying is that even though you claimed to have studied evolution , you have not .

Partial-birth abortion is done only in a case when the mother 's life is at stake , no , it does not always `` save the mother 's life `` in some cases it is done as a prophylaxis against an event in which life-saving measures would be deemed neccessary . Example- the mother has advanced liver disease , when she concieved it seemed as though it would be possible to carry the child , but as her pregnancy advanced , so did her disease , so that now she is in complete renal failure . The doctors advise her that if she continues with her pregnancy , she is putting her own life and that of ther child into jeopardy . He urges her to abort the child , in order to save her life . This is one case where a partial-birth abortion would be the method . If the woman decides to continue her pregnancy , she might die , the child might die as well . But if she chooses not to have the child , she lives to fight another day . Tough choices- What right on earth would I have to enter into this situation and tell her that `` god says you got ta put your life at risk and carry this child , even though both of you might die `` ? ? ? ? I may be sick , but I pride myself on the ability to create an informed opinion on a matter , and until I am informed , I keep my opinions to myself . That should be in the bible somewhere""",DISAGREE,"""is not just wrong in a Christian belief . YOu 're sick if you support it .""","""Your obvious ignorance of medical procedure is astonishing ."""

Kathleen McChesney , executive director of the Office of Child and Youth Protection of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , said the overwhelming majority of the accusations , which were made against 756 priests , concerned incidents that took place about 30 years ago .

The findings were released on Friday by the national conference , which has hired independent auditors to assess the church 's response to the sex abuse scandals that exploded in 2002 . Dr. McChesney said the costs to the church had exceeded $ 800 million since 1950 . Last year alone the costs from settlements , therapy for victims and offenders , and lawyers ' fees came to about $ 139.6 million , according to the report . The 1,092 new accusations of abuse were made by 1,083 people , mostly men . Last year the bishops released an analysis conducted by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York , based on figures from bishops and religious orders , that found 10,667 minors had allegedly been abused from 1950 to 2002 .

5084,"""The fear on the street is palpable . Ever since the election of Barack Obama as President of these United States in November 2008 , coupled with the election of a democrat party majority in both the U.S. House and Senate , concern for the United States and personal safety has ignited like a fire in dry grass . < snip > What is odd about this new fear is that it is not coming from the average citizen gun owner out there , but it is coming from what to me is an almost shocking source : street cops . Street cops and SWAT cops that I know from various agencies Â– rural , suburban and metro Â– in my area are scared . Cops that before November 2008 never gave much thought ( that I knew of anyway ) to politics or more importantly to gun rights . For the most part , these are the guys that didnÂ ’ t generally have any interest in shooting or gun ownership beyond keeping track of where their duty gun is , and a few of them didnÂ ’ t even do that so well . The guys I am talking about now are some of the same guys who used to not even carry off duty on a regular basis- but not anymore . They donÂ ’ t scare easily , defenders of the Constitution of this State and the United States ( as our oath of office reads ) , have been buying ARs , survival gear , and all the ammo they can lay their hands on . All of them ( or I should say Â “ usÂ ” ) have been discussing and have been acquiring guns to provide a layered perimeter defense . What are we suddenly so afraid of ? Well in our discussions it seems to boil down to four areas ... First , fear of federal government intrusion into our lives . Every time I look at or listen to the news , there is something new and intrusive coming out of the Obama administration and this Congress . New tax schemes , government-run Canadian-style healthcare , a volunteer citizen defense force ( whatever that is , what happened to the National Guard ? ) equipped with funding similar to our military , forced voluntary Â “ serviceÂ ” after retirement , a lack of a southern border with hordes of illegal and criminal aliens pouring over our border , the swine flu scare as well as government forced closing of thousands of privately held Chrysler and GM dealerships , which will be the final nail in the coffin for these companies and the list goes on and on . But these items in the news are just the tip of the iceberg . We canÂ ’ t see the full impact of these actions yet , but we donÂ ’ t know what was added into the thousand of pages of stimulus package bills in the dead of night yet . I predict however that when the plans contained in the stimulus packages go into effect , a lot of us are going to be surprised if not shocked by what has suddenly and sweepingly changed . What also scares us is the second , well-founded fear that there is an assault weapons ban looming , one that would make the Clinton Ban appear like a look of disdain in comparison . I remember well the 1990s and the Clinton years : the rise of militia groups , the Â “ black helicopterÂ ” rumors and paranoia , all of which was motivated by the Brady Law and the Assault WeaponÂ ’ s ban . What if a new ban comes requiring registration or confiscation and turn-in of banned weapons as what happened in Australia ? I foresee much civil disobedience coming down the road . Americans are citizens , and not subjects like the British , Canadians or Australians . They just donÂ ’ t always obey the law blindly and not one officer or citizen that I spoke to said anything like Â “ I hope I get to keep this gun for awhile before they are banned ; They are fun to shoot , so I would hate to give it up.Â ” It isnÂ ’ t going to happen , so the cop on the street and the soldier on the base needs to think now what he will do if the orders come down . I think you all get what I am saying here . Which leads me to the third fear , that there is a revolution coming , yes , a revolution on the scale of the original American Revolution . You can hear this topic discussed on many of the talk radio shows by even the big name hosts . The possibility of an armed revolution against the U.S. government being discussed , albeit very gingerly and fleetingly and as something to be avoided , which it is . I never heard this mentioned in the 90s . One of my quietest , low profile officer friends brought it up the other day . He said that at some point in the near future , he felt there is going to be an armed revolt if things keep going the way they are . Something has got to give . I was shocked . Yes , I had heard this from some of my more radical cop friends in the past , but to hear it from a guy like this was unprecedented . Now , these guys are not saying this will happen to foment revolution , preach sedition or to even participate . They just want to be ready if it happens , to at least defend their families , because number four on the fear list is general societal chaos . Cops fear for their parents , wives , children or grandchildren more now than ever before . Most cops are encouraging their spouses and loved ones to get concealed carry permits . Not only that , but some of these same cops are buying gun mounts for their personal cars so they can carry an AR in the family ride at the ready all the time . They are also strapping on heavier forms of off-duty hardware .

5084,"""The fear on the street is palpable . Ever since the election of Barack Obama as President of these United States in November 2008 , coupled with the election of a democrat party majority in both the U.S. House and Senate , concern for the United States and personal safety has ignited like a fire in dry grass . < snip > What is odd about this new fear is that it is not coming from the average citizen gun owner out there , but it is coming from what to me is an almost shocking source : street cops . Street cops and SWAT cops that I know from various agencies Â– rural , suburban and metro Â– in my area are scared . Cops that before November 2008 never gave much thought ( that I knew of anyway ) to politics or more importantly to gun rights . For the most part , these are the guys that didnÂ ’ t generally have any interest in shooting or gun ownership beyond keeping track of where their duty gun is , and a few of them didnÂ ’ t even do that so well . The guys I am talking about now are some of the same guys who used to not even carry off duty on a regular basis- but not anymore . They donÂ ’ t scare easily , defenders of the Constitution of this State and the United States ( as our oath of office reads ) , have been buying ARs , survival gear , and all the ammo they can lay their hands on . All of them ( or I should say Â “ usÂ ” ) have been discussing and have been acquiring guns to provide a layered perimeter defense . What are we suddenly so afraid of ? Well in our discussions it seems to boil down to four areas ... First , fear of federal government intrusion into our lives . Every time I look at or listen to the news , there is something new and intrusive coming out of the Obama administration and this Congress . New tax schemes , government-run Canadian-style healthcare , a volunteer citizen defense force ( whatever that is , what happened to the National Guard ? ) equipped with funding similar to our military , forced voluntary Â “ serviceÂ ” after retirement , a lack of a southern border with hordes of illegal and criminal aliens pouring over our border , the swine flu scare as well as government forced closing of thousands of privately held Chrysler and GM dealerships , which will be the final nail in the coffin for these companies and the list goes on and on . But these items in the news are just the tip of the iceberg . We canÂ ’ t see the full impact of these actions yet , but we donÂ ’ t know what was added into the thousand of pages of stimulus package bills in the dead of night yet . I predict however that when the plans contained in the stimulus packages go into effect , a lot of us are going to be surprised if not shocked by what has suddenly and sweepingly changed . What also scares us is the second , well-founded fear that there is an assault weapons ban looming , one that would make the Clinton Ban appear like a look of disdain in comparison . I remember well the 1990s and the Clinton years : the rise of militia groups , the Â “ black helicopterÂ ” rumors and paranoia , all of which was motivated by the Brady Law and the Assault WeaponÂ ’ s ban . What if a new ban comes requiring registration or confiscation and turn-in of banned weapons as what happened in Australia ? I foresee much civil disobedience coming down the road . Americans are citizens , and not subjects like the British , Canadians or Australians . They just donÂ ’ t always obey the law blindly and not one officer or citizen that I spoke to said anything like Â “ I hope I get to keep this gun for awhile before they are banned ; They are fun to shoot , so I would hate to give it up.Â ” It isnÂ ’ t going to happen , so the cop on the street and the soldier on the base needs to think now what he will do if the orders come down . I think you all get what I am saying here . Which leads me to the third fear , that there is a revolution coming , yes , a revolution on the scale of the original American Revolution . You can hear this topic discussed on many of the talk radio shows by even the big name hosts . The possibility of an armed revolution against the U.S. government being discussed , albeit very gingerly and fleetingly and as something to be avoided , which it is . I never heard this mentioned in the 90s . One of my quietest , low profile officer friends brought it up the other day . He said that at some point in the near future , he felt there is going to be an armed revolt if things keep going the way they are . Something has got to give . I was shocked . Yes , I had heard this from some of my more radical cop friends in the past , but to hear it from a guy like this was unprecedented . Now , these guys are not saying this will happen to foment revolution , preach sedition or to even participate . They just want to be ready if it happens , to at least defend their families , because number four on the fear list is general societal chaos . Cops fear for their parents , wives , children or grandchildren more now than ever before . Most cops are encouraging their spouses and loved ones to get concealed carry permits . Not only that , but some of these same cops are buying gun mounts for their personal cars so they can carry an AR in the family ride at the ready all the time . They are also strapping on heavier forms of off-duty hardware .

Think about this , you have bits and pieces of car for over a hundred metres depending on the severity . I'ld hate to be involved in one like that !

With the publication of `` Feathers for T. rex ? `` by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue , National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic , unsubstantiated , tabloid journalism . But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature . Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas `` will later name `` the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis , there is no longer any need for him to do so . Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen `` accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon , `` the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic ( International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , Article 13a , i ) . This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists -- -that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist . Clearly , National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters . Sloan 's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that `` the Czerkases now plan to return it to China. `` In Washington , in June of 1996 , more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution , held at the Smithsonian Institution , were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation . There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message . Thus , at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband . Most , if not all , major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin . The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material , but has sensationalized , and is now exhibiting , an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally , administratively , and perhaps legally , off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions . Prior to the publication of the article `` Dinosaurs Take Wing `` in the July 1998 National Geographic , Lou Mazzatenta , the photographer for Sloan 's article , invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story . At that time , I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present , but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs . Sloan 's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that `` makes `` the news rather than reporting it . His bald statement that `` we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals `` is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists , so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing . This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology , which , of course , are never mentioned . More importantly , however , none of the structures illustrated in Sloan 's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers . Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact . The statement on page 103 that `` hollow , hairlike structures characterize protofeathers `` is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct , so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical . The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse , and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers . A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers , all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction . The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith . Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age -- -the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion . If Sloan 's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia , it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken .

9034,"""The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . Rights Retained by the People Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary , the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those . 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives . '' It has been objected also against a bill of rights , that , by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power , it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration ; and it might follow by implication , that those rights which were not singled out , were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government , and were consequently insecure . This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system ; but , I conceive , that it may be guarded against . I have attempted it , as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution .

9034,"""The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . Rights Retained by the People Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary , the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those . 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives . '' It has been objected also against a bill of rights , that , by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power , it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration ; and it might follow by implication , that those rights which were not singled out , were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government , and were consequently insecure . This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system ; but , I conceive , that it may be guarded against . I have attempted it , as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution .

Our experiments ( we experimented with this at work when we were working on a contract related to ceramic body armor ) showed that this will go through TWO kevlar vests and 16 inched of ballistics gel , which implies rather heavily that you can reasonably expect to shoot right through 2 police officers using the round , vest or no .

For those who do not follow such things , the FN five seven fires a new round , the 5.7x28 . There are 2 versions of the round availabe , one is an aluminum base , steel core , FMJ round designed to pierce body armor . It is not available to civilians int he US , it is law enforcement only . The other round avaliable IS a civilian round , it is a hollowpoint which has already been cleared by the ATF as a non armor piercing round . The civilian round ( the non AP one ) WILL pierce body armor , as will a .22 magnum , and most solid point .22 LR rounds . Body armor is specifically designed to take the implact from large , slow moving rounds , not small , fast rounds . I am also a little confused as to what makes this an `` assault pistol `` . I have 2 of them . I purchsed them specifically because when the civilian version came out , I fully expected that thet antigunners would pitch a fit and we would see attempts to ban the weapon , which would boost the value of them . They pretty much look like a glock . Why is the five seven an `` assault pistol `` and the glock is not ? While I am sure we are all used to GG 's pushing for bans that have no basis in reality , even I was a little surprised that they moved so quickly on this one . Now , my anti social side is pushing me to pass on a secret regarding AP rounds . If you want a REALLY good AP round , get a 7.62x25 ( tokarev ) . You can pick up a pistol for this caliber VERY cheap ( $ 200 or less for a good makarov ) . Hand load your rounds , but instead of using the 7.62 , order some .30 sabots .
