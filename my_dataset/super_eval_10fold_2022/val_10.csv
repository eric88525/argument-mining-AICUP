90,"""Has anyone ever observed one animal change into another animal ?""","""Yes . For example , the hawthorn maggot fly was observed to change into the apple maggot fly in only a few years . I also gave the example of the herring gull/lesser black-backed gull that exists as a single , continuous population the circles the globe in which the extremes have become seperate species . Of course , what you are asking is if it has ever been observed that a frog turned into a lion . But that is n't evolution .

106,"""Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement , including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture . While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice , the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally , as they would a science textbook . Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible Â– the Creation , Adam and Eve , Noah and the ark Â– convey timeless truths about God , human beings , and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation . Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth . Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts . We the undersigned , Christian clergy from many different traditions , believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist . We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth , one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests . To reject this truth or to treat it as Â “ one theory among othersÂ ” is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children . We believe that among GodÂ ’ s good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator . To argue that GodÂ ’ s loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God , an act of hubris . We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge . We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion , two very different , but complementary , forms of truth .""","""Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected , and have endorsed this letter .""",AGREE,"""virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth""","""signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected , have endorsed this letter ."""

Along with the rest of the country , we wish the Fort Hood community a return to a secure and safe environment . Â “ When I heard of the tragedy yesterday , we were in the midst of planning a response to the latest dangerous legislative proposal from the gun lobby in the United States Senate - language to automatically restore access to guns to veterans designated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Justice Department as Â ‘ mentally incapacitatedÂ ’ or Â ‘ mentally incompetent.Â ’ In light of what happened yesterday - a violent attack by an emotionally unstable soldier - it is even clearer that the proposal being pushed by Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina should be rejected . Â “ America has seen an epidemic of horrific gun violence at churches and synagogues , workplaces , health clubs , high schools , universities , police stations and now Army bases . This latest tragedy , at a heavily fortified army base , ought to convince more Americans to reject the argument that the solution to gun violence is to arm more people with more guns in more places . Enough is enough.Â ” # # # As the nation 's largest , non-partisan , grassroots organization leading the fight to prevent gun violence , the Brady Campaign , with its dedicated network of Million Mom March Chapters , works to enact and enforce sensible gun laws , regulations and public policies .

Â “ When I heard of the tragedy yesterday , we were in the midst of planning a response to the latest dangerous legislative proposal from the gun lobby in the United States Senate - language to automatically restore access to guns to veterans designated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Justice Department as Â ‘ mentally incapacitatedÂ ’ or Â ‘ mentally incompetent.Â ’ In light of what happened yesterday - a violent attack by an emotionally unstable soldier - it is even clearer that the proposal being pushed by Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina should be rejected . Â “ America has seen an epidemic of horrific gun violence at churches and synagogues , workplaces , health clubs , high schools , universities , police stations and now Army bases . This latest tragedy , at a heavily fortified army base , ought to convince more Americans to reject the argument that the solution to gun violence is to arm more people with more guns in more places . Enough is enough.Â ” # # # As the nation 's largest , non-partisan , grassroots organization leading the fight to prevent gun violence , the Brady Campaign , with its dedicated network of Million Mom March Chapters , works to enact and enforce sensible gun laws , regulations and public policies . The Brady Campaign is devoted to creating an America free from gun violence , where all Americans are safe at home , at school , at work , and in our communities .

2025,"""What makes you so certain that the minority is right on this issue ?""","""Well , now this is the question that really matters , and the answer is a long one . But to state it as simply as possible : denying same-sex marriage hurts many people . It forces same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples while no one is forced to pay for their marriages . It denies them access to raise children and ability to cover their children and spouses with their medical insurance , along with the many other benefits of marriage . It uses the law to teach the people that the lifestyle and religion held by same-sex couples is wrong , and this forces them to feel the disapproval of society . There is no reason to perpetuate these harms . I have heard many arguments opposed to same-sex marriage , but there is not even one of them that justifies these harms . In fact , I would even say that there is not one argument against same-sex marriage that makes logical sense at all . Thus , even if same-sex marriage brought no benefits , there would be no reason to keep it illegal ; a free and equal society does not deny rights or benefits to anyone , unless it has a very good reason to . And there just is n't any reason to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples .""",DISAGREE,"""makes you so certain that the minority is right""","""It forces same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples while no one is forced to pay for their marriages"""

Accusations of being a 'materialist ' similarly have no teeth in this discussion , for the very simple reason that if a Vital force exists and can influence the physical world then it too belongs to the natural and material , rather than the supernatural . Materialism would simply expand to accommodate it , as it has with other forces .""","""* * A couple of quick poiints . First , you are very emotionally involved in the materialist/mechanist metaphysic , whether you grasp the full implications of that metaphysic , [ beyond its denial of certain religious mythologies ] , or not . Otherwise you would not so vehemently and tenaciously defend that metaphysic against any suggerstionthatits take on reality , its ontology/cosmoly , is incorrect -- even when , as in the case of EAM , that suggestion comes from a metaphysical quarter that has no ideological connection to any religious mythology , and in fact is also antithetical to those myths .""",DISAGREE,"""Accusations of being a 'materialist ' similarly have no teeth in this discussion""","""you are very emotionally involved in the materialist/mechanist metaphysic"""

When we got organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical Constitution with a radical Bill of Rights , giving a radical amount of individual freedom to Americans ... And so a lot of people say there 's too much personal freedom . When personal freedom 's being abused , you have to move to limit it . That 's what we did in the announcement I made last weekend on the public housing projects , about how we 're going to have weapon sweeps and more things like that to try to make people safer in their communities . We ca n't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans ... Cockrum v. State The right of a citizen to bear arms , in lawful defense of himself or the State , is absolute . He does not derive it from the State government . It is one of the high powers `` delegated directly to the citizen , and ` is excepted out of the general powers of government . ' A law can not be passed to infringe upon or impair it , because it is above the law , and independent of the lawmaking power . Rev . Nicholas Collin While the people have property , arms in their hands , and only a spark of noble spirit , the most corrupt Congress must be mad to form any project of tyranny . Tench CoxeThe militia of these free commonwealths , entitled and accustomed to their arms , when compared with any possible army , must be tremendous and irresistible . Who are the militia ? Are they not ourselves ? Is it feared , then , that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom . Congress have no power to disarm the militia . Their swords , and every other terrible implement of the soldier , are the birth-right of an American ... the unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments , but , where I trust in God it will ever remain , in the hands of the people . Whereas civil rulers , not having their duty to the people duly before them , may attempt to tyrannize , and as military forces , which must be occasionally raised to defend our country , might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens , the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms .""","""`` The right was in the context of the citizen soldier of the conscript militia . In the eighteenth century private arms were never strictly private . The public had a claim for public purposes . Coxe was a strong Federalist . He was employed in Hamilton 's Treasury Department during the Whiskey Rebellion . He expressed no concerns that the enrollment and inventory requirements of the Militia Act would infringe on right of the people to keep and bear their private arms. `` http : //www.potowmack.org/thequotes.html # coxe So Tench Coxe put quite a bit a faith in the power of the militia ? George Washington and Alexander Hamilton did n't agree . They thought that the militia was no match for a regular army . '' Regular troops alone are equal to the exignencies of modern war , as well for defense as for offense .... No militia will ever acquire the habits necessary to resist regular force .... The Firmness requisite for the real business of fighting is only to be attained by a constant course of discipline and service . I have never been yet been witness to a single instance that would justify a different opinion. `` ( Letter from George Washington to the President of Congress- September 15,1780 ) `` Here I expect we shall be told that the militia of the country is its natural bulwark , and would be at all times equal to the national defense . This doctrine , in substance , had like to have lost us our independence . It cost millions to the United States that might have been saved . The facts which , from our own experience , forbid a reliance of this kind , are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of such a suggestion . The steady operations of war against a regular and disciplined army can only be successfully conducted by a force of the same kind. `` -Alexander Hamilton http : //federalistpapers.com/federalist25.html""",DISAGREE,"""William S.

The headline on the release : `` Connecting the Dots : The Line Between Gay Marriage and Mass Murders. `` The group 's president , Bob Peters , notes that the `` underlying problem is that increasingly we live in a 'post-Christian ' society , where Judeo-Christian faith and values have less and less influence. `` And , he continues , this `` secular value system is also reflected in the 'sexual revolution , ' which is the driving force behind the push for 'gay marriage . ' '' Here 's the punch line : It most certainly is not my intention to blame the epidemic of mass murders on the gay rights movement ! It is my intention to point out that the success of the sexual revolution is inversely proportional to the decline in morality ; and it is the decline of morality ( and the faith that so often under girds it ) that is the underlying cause of our modern day epidemic of mass murders . That is , he 's not saying that gay rights activists are directly responsible for the murderous actions of gun-toting madmen . But Peters maintains that those who champion gay rights are undermining the moral fiber of society and that this assault on traditional values creates an environment in which killing sprees can more easily occur . These acts of gun violence , he insists , are the poisoned fruit of the push for gay marriage . Talk about exploiting tragedy to advance an agenda . It might be tempting to dismiss Peters and Morality in Media as marginal , but this group did receive federal funding from 2005 through 2007 . The money supported a Morality in Media project , ObscenityCrimes.org , which paid two retired law enforcement officers to review citizen complaints about obscenity on the Internet and to forward the best leads to the US Justice Department for possible prosecution . A total of $ 300,000 was provided to Morality in Media through two earmarks Rep. Frank Wolf ( R-Va. ) placed into spending bills , according to Peters . And a portion of that money went to cover Peters ' salary . As The New York Times reported in 2007 , no obscenity prosecutions had resulted from the Morality in Media 's obscenity-tracking work . Peters tells me that since 2007 -- thanks to the fuss about earmarks -- he has received no more funds from the US government . After the earmarked grants ran out in 2007 , he did apply directly to the Justice Department and was turned down . Since then , he has raised private funds to keep ObscenityCrimes.org going . That may be for the best -- particularly for Morality in Media . Peters has recently attacked President Barack Obama 's pick for deputy attorney general , David Ogden , as an `` ACLU-minded `` sort who would `` likely weaken `` government efforts `` to curb sexual trafficking and sexual exploitation of children. `` It would be difficult -- or , at least , awkward -- for Peters to blast a Justice Department that was funding his own work .

2805,"""Fifty-seven percent ( 57 % ) of Americans say gun sales are up in the United States because of a fear of increased government restriction on gun ownership . A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey shows that just 23 % say gun sales have risen because of a fear of increased crime . Twenty-one percent ( 21 % ) are not sure . Sixty-three percent ( 63 % ) of men say the threat of more gun control is behind increased sales , compared to 51 % of women . Fifty-nine percent ( 59 % ) of whites agree , while African-Americans are more closely divided on the question . Similarly , 65 % of Republicans and 66 % of those not affiliated with either major political party say gun sales are up due to a fear of increased government restriction . But a plurality of Democrats agrees by just 10 points . Seventy-one percent ( 71 % ) of Americans believe it is at least somewhat likely that President Obama will seek tougher gun control laws , including 43 % who say it is very likely . In March , 43 % of Americans said the United States needed more gun control laws , but 47 % disagreed . This marked a slight drop in support for more gun control from last year .""","""For the gun banners who are thinking , you paranoid delusional low lives ! Uh .

Science taught that the world was the centre of the universe . The leading scientists convinced churchmen to take allegorical passages of the Bible and re-interpret them as literal . The ancient Greeks , who were esteemed in Europe as the pre-eminent scientists of their day believed this . They also believed that people were made up of four elements . And taught this . Scientists backed up racism `` No rational man ( writes Thomas Huxley , a contemporary evolutionist ) , cognizant of the facts , believes that the average Negro is the equal , still less the superior , of the white man . And if this be true , it is simply incredible that , when all his disabilities are removed , and our prognathous relative has a fair field and no favor , as well as no oppressor , he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger-brained and smaller-jawed rival , in a contest which is to be carried out on by thoughts and not by bites. `` ( Thomas H.

That turns out to be the case , except for minor variations in some primitive forms of life , the DNA code is identical across life . We would expect to see a nested hierarchy of species and we do . We find that house cats are similar to the other 36 species of cat , which are carnivores , which are mammals , which are tetrapods , which are vertebrates , which are chordates . We would expect to find transitional species between major groups of animals , and we do . We find feathered dinosaurs and birds with bony tails and teeth . We find whales with feet . We find reptiles that are very much like mammals , even some with a double jointed jaw that was part of the transition of reptile jaw bones to the inner ear of mammals . We even find mammals that lay eggs .""",DISAGREE,"""Evolutionary kinship of all creatures would imply a continuous intergrading of all forms of life""","""However , there are some things that we might expect if all life is descended from a common ancestor"""

4301,"""( CNN ) -- Drug traffickers are planting millions of marijuana plants on U.S. public lands ever closer to tourist sites , guarding their plots with heavy weaponry , federal authorities say .

'' It 's definitely possible that hikers and campers are going to find themselves in the middle of a field facing some very dangerous , armed bad guys , because this problem is everywhere , and it 's only getting worse. `` Across the nation , pot sites linked to cartels have been found in 15 states as far north as Washington , Arthur said . Last week , a portion of Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada was closed to visitors while rangers dropped from helicopters into a marijuana farm a half-mile away from Crystal Cave , popular among tourists . Officials said there were five sites in the Yucca Creek Canyon where investigators recovered tons of trash , netting , chemicals and camping materials , a discovery that suggested the growers had been there , or planned to stay , for a long time . Though authorities destroyed the patch , whoever wanted to profit probably got what they wanted . Seventy-five percent of the plants had been harvested , said park spokeswoman Adrienne Freeman . '' Last week for six days , instead of having families and children walking down to Crystal Cave , we were flying helicopters to do a law enforcement operation , `` she said . '' That 's not fair .

This week , the National Park Service was working to eradicate plants at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore , beloved by fishermen , where one year ago the agency brought out six dump trucks full of marijuana -- 10,000 plants -- valued at $ 8.5 million , according to chief ranger Mike Bremer . And on Friday , the Drug Enforcement Administration said it had found 14,500 marijuana plants growing in a patch of forest land 40 miles southwest of Denver , Colorado , where campers have ventured . The Forest Service has stepped up its efforts to raid forest areas in Georgia and Tennessee , including areas near the Chattahoochee River , a favorite among hikers , campers and adventure racers . The agency has started podcasting and posting signs on public land , trying to describe to regular folks what a pot field looks like and how to get away from it quickly .

When authorities surprise them by dropping into their camps , growers dart off to hiding places or through the thick woods , making foot chases difficult .

I get the impression that you view women as having a responsibility over their offspring from the point of conception on - i.e . not only in late term . I would contest this . Up to around the beginning of the third trimester , the embryo / fetus is nothing but a developing body with `` nobody home `` - i.e . no mental existence ( no thoughts , no emotions , no sense of self , no feelings of pain , no ability to experience their environment - nothing ) . I do not see any reason to have forced responsibility over such a living mindless body . As at the end of life when the mind can be gone from accident or illness , it is not worth keeping the empty living body artificially alive . It is the person who effectively resides in the body ( through mental brain function or belief in a soul ) who we value - not the body itself . From discussions with those on the pro-life side , it seems clear that the thing that is valued in the embryo / early fetus is not as much what it currently IS but what it WILL BECOME . What it currently IS is only valued because it is on its way to becoming something / someone that we do value . The hypothetical question to test this was how much is such a life valued if it suddenly stopped growing so that it would never reach the stage of lifeform that has emotions , thoughts , feelings of pain , etc . Apparently , its value dropped significantly ( at least that was the answer for those not afraid of anwering that question ) .

I have found that the best way to discover such holes and inconsistencies in reasoning is to see what type of questions people make an effort at avoiding to answer . Where the pro-life camp is concerned , I find that a major hole in their reasoning is to highlight what the embryo / early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT , independent of what it will become in the future . This has highlighted that it is only valued by what it WILL BECOME , not for what it currently IS . As for the extreme pro-choice side that would allow abortions at all times for any reason ( note : they represent a minority of the pro-choice side ) , then they get very uncomfortable when you question them about the difference in a fetus one day from birth vs a newborn baby and force them to answer the question of whether or not they would allow a birth-minus-one-day abortion for any reason .

Behemoth has the following attributes according to Job 40:15-24 It Â “ eats grass like an ox.Â ” It Â “ moves his tail like a cedar.Â ” ( In Hebrew , this literally reads , Â “ he lets hang his tail like a cedar.Â ” ) Its Â “ bones are like beams of bronze , His ribs like bars of iron.Â ” Â “ He is the first of the ways of God.Â ” Â “ He lies under the lotus trees , In a covert of reeds and marsh.Â ” Job 40:15-24 ( New International Version ) 15 `` Look at the behemoth , [ a ] which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox . 16 What strength he has in his loins , what power in the muscles of his belly ! 17 His tail [ b ] sways like a cedar ; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit . 18 His bones are tubes of bronze , his limbs like rods of iron . 19 He ranks first among the works of God , yet his Maker can approach him with his sword . 20 The hills bring him their produce , and all the wild animals play nearby . 21 Under the lotus plants he lies , hidden among the reeds in the marsh . 22 The lotuses conceal him in their shadow ; the poplars by the stream surround him . 23 When the river rages , he is not alarmed ; he is secure , though the Jordan should surge against his mouth . 24 Can anyone capture him by the eyes , [ c ] or trap him and pierce his nose ? Leviathan has the following attributes according to Job chapter 41 , Psalm 104:25,26 and Isaiah 27:1 . This is only a partial listingÂ—just enough to make the point . Â “ No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up.Â ” Â “ Who can open the doors of his face , with his terrible teeth all around ? Â ” Â “ His rows of scales are his pride , shut up tightly as with a seal ; one is so near another that no air can come between them ; they are joined one to another , they stick together and can not be parted.Â ” Â “ His sneezings flash forth light , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . Out of his mouth go burning lights ; sparks of fire shoot out . Smoke goes out of his nostrils , as from a boiling pot and burning rushes . His breath kindles coals , and a flame goes out of his mouth.Â ” Â “ Though the sword reaches him , it can not avail ; nor does spear , dart , or javelin . He regards iron as straw , and bronze as rotten wood . The arrow can not make him flee ; slingstones become like stubble to him . Darts are regarded as straw ; he laughs at the threat of javelins.Â ” Â “ On earth there is nothing like him , which is made without fear.Â ” Leviathan Â “ playedÂ ” in the Â “ great and wide seaÂ ” ( a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26Â—get the exact sense by reading them yourself ) . Leviathan is a Â “ reptile [ a ] that is in the sea.Â ” ( Isaiah 27:1 ) [ a ] Note : The word translated Â “ reptileÂ ” here is the Hebrew word tanniyn . This shows that Â “ LeviathanÂ ” was also a Â “ tanniynÂ ” ( dragon ) . Job 41:18-21 18 By his exhaling a light does shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . 19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out . 20 Out of his nostrils goes smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron . 21 His breath kindles coals , and a flame goes out of his mouth . Isa 27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that [ is ] in the sea . How do we rationally explain these creatures existence so recently in our human history if they were extinct for millions of years ? And if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe , then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence ? And while your at it , ask yourself if it 's reasonable that the bones of dead creatures have survived from 60 million years to some estimated to be more than 200 million years without becoming dust ? Does that make rational sense to you ? Just look at the egyptian embalming methods for preserving the Pharaohs . They are still a marvel to modern scientists yet they are nothing more than frail shells no more solid than the texture of a bees nest after a short 3000 to 4000 years in a dry and sealed sarcophagus . Yet bones/fossils buried in the Earth with the upheavals , alkalis and acids in the earth in addition to the weather have survived over 60 million years ? You must ask yourself if sciences explanations pass the smell test in the realm of common sense . And that decision is yours alone .""","""This is why religion may not survive the future .

5356,"""I do n't believe it is DrNo , because by its very definition evolution claims that Man evolved from the lower animals . It relegates us to nothing more than a biological organism with no more value than an viral bacteria . Another problem you run into regarding Genesis is the spiritual relationship Man has with God and Adams fall from grace . Evolution erases that relationship which erases the need for the need for being reunited with God through the shed blood of Christ on the Cross . Also , you must redefine what evolution teaches altogether in order to credit God with original creation and then assume evolution is His plan for humanity . That 's why the evolutionists are rejecting your premise out of hand . Your version of it is a sacrilege because it goes from being Natural to Supernatural if God is credited with original Creation . One must not compromise what the bible says in order to find a happy medium with the worlds philosophies . That is folly and will only lead to confusion . What you should ask yourself is why are beasts which can only be described as dinosaurs be found mentioned in the bible ?

'' It is very easily converted back to automatic. `` Automatic weapons , even those converted to semi-automatic fire , are prohibited in Canada . Guns that can be easily converted to fully automatic fire are also prohibited .

5892,"""The recent confiscation of a formerly legal firearm has raised questions about how the RCMP inspects imported firearms and has forced a change of national firearms policy . The RCMP will be physically checking every assault-style rifle that enters the country from now on . Before the change , verifiers were used to check to make sure the guns are what the exporter said they would be . Verifiers could be anyone with knowledge of firearms and were given a one-day course from the RCMP . Businesses that sell weapons were able to nominate their own verifiers . But the discovery of a gun the RCMP says should never have made it into Canada has highlighted potential problems with the verifier program . There is concern that the first loyalty of business verifiers is to the business and that this could hurt the accuracy of the verifications . '' We 've identified an issue with [ the program ] , `` said Marty Cheliak , the director general of the Canadian Firearms Program . '' There 's a perception of a conflict of interest that may be prevalent . In this case , we 're looking into that for sure. `` Cheliak was referring to the case of the Norinco Type 97A rifle . Sixty of the Chinese-made guns were imported between December 2006 and November 2007 . They were initially classified as restricted , based on information from the importer , photos , specifications from the manufacturer and an inspection by a business-nominated verifier . In October 2009 , the Canada Border Services Agency alerted the RCMP to a second shipment . This time the rifles were given a full physical inspection by the RCMP , which determined the rifles should be prohibited . '' Why did they make a mistake ? `` asked Blair Hagen , president of the National Firearms Association . '' If the RCMP made the mistake in the first place , that has some very serious ramifications. `` In March , the RCMP sent letters to owners of the Norinco Type 97A rifles , demanding they turn in the guns . This came after the RCMP decided the gun was prohibited after determining it could be easily converted to fully automatic fire . '' It was a purpose-built fully automatic firearm with the fully automatic features disabled by [ Norinco ] which were not reported to us , `` Cheliak said . '' It is very easily converted back to automatic. `` Automatic weapons , even those converted to semi-automatic fire , are prohibited in Canada . Guns that can be easily converted to fully automatic fire are also prohibited . The firearms association believes the gun was illegally reclassified , and some members plan to go to court to fight the seizures . '' The NFA is very concerned about the RCMP 's unilateral reclassification of this particular firearm and believes there should be a more transparent process in place to explain it , `` Hagen said . '' Apparently , they 've done a report on this . However , they 've refused to release that report . I think what 's required here is some transparency . '' They should demonstrate that to the owners and to the firearms community , so that everyone knows the truth and we can make a determination if the classification was indeed legitimate. `` Cheliak suggested the process is transparent enough . '' Why would we , the RCMP , or any police service give out information to any group & # 8230 ; on how to convert a firearm from semi-automatic to fully automatic ?

I must point out that even if we consider it abnormal , there is no reason to suggest that abnormal is somehow bad . In a free and equal society , abnormal deserves all the rights and privleges thet normal receives . Any benefits that exist in allowing same-sex marriage are n't being weighed down by abnormality . [ quote ] The concept of equality is a lot easier to conceptualize than to put into practice . We , as a society , preach equality in principle , but practice inequality in all aspects of our lives . As I mentioned above , the tax code is a great example of institutionalized inequality . Businesses practice institutionalized inequality daily . For example , I am considered , by my employer , to be an HCI ( highly compensated individual ) . As a result , I pay a much higher rate for the same healthcare coverage that my fellow employees get . Is that fair ?

The difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple . In microevolution a species is simply adapting to it 's environments . In evolution as is usually meant by the word you are talking about the formation of an entirely new creature from inorganic compounds . If this is possible I pose a few questions for you . 1 ) Why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory ? 2 ) How did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve , while others of the same species did not ? Why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now ? Why did n't all apes evolve into humans ? 3 ) One of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils . How do you know how old a fossil is ? Every evolutionist I have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in , but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it ! That 's a classical example of circular reasoning . I am not a scientist , so I can not present all the evidence against evolution as clearly as someone with a scientific education and background might do .

Risks of STIs including AIDS and unwanted pregnancy are obvious examples that can be largely avoided by not having sex . Cervical cancer is triggered by a virus that a woman is exposed to through sex . Even if she does not contract any STD , there is a high correlation between rates of cervical cancer , HPV ( human papolloma virus ) , and having intercource . Cervical cancer almost never occurs in virgins , and there is a high rate of occurrence in women who have had multiple sex partners . Abstinent women also have lower rates of urinary tract infections and vaginitis . Those can be caused by skin being dragged into the vagina inadvertently during intercourse , and the penis has bacteria on it just like all skin . Teenage girls also would obviously have higher levels of academic achievement if they are abstinent . Less depression and emotional turmoil due to relationship problems if they are abstinent , as well as less domestic or partner abuse . However , I do n't believe that advocating abstinence only is a smart way of approaching a problem . Obviously very few people are abstinent all of their lives ; intercourse is a normal part of a healthy lifestyle .

The first portion , `` A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , `` is a qualifier to what follows `` the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed. `` It seems pretty clear to me . But I 'm not one of the Justices . This decision has been made , although I do n't like it or agree with it . I do n't see where today 's hobbyist meets the intent - most especially in the well-regulated part . But there comes a point where what the dead guys thought just does n't matter that much . It is 200+ years later . They left us with the ability to adjust with time and we 've done that . They recognized their own shortcomings which might have the the wisest thing they did . The current interpretation is clear . We look at the last portion of the statement only . I do n't think that , as I said before , a little common sense , is going to alter the interpretation in any meaningful way . After all , I could easily argue ( if I was totally stupid ) that my front yard is the perfect place for a working cannon . We both know that is n't going to fly . Just where does the armament argument end . With a cannon ? Or with a Nuc . Let 's face it . They said arms and they meant arms . Not guns . They 'd probably let me have the cannon . The founding fathers never envisioned the kind of weapons we 'd have available today or what they 'd be used for . That 's why their thoughts are purposely criptic and open ended . Since we will always draw the line someplace , why not draw it at a good compromise between you and me .""","""You asked where the line should be drawn in regards to weapons ? How about where ownership and use of weapons does not violate the rights of others . Before you respons think about it . Do anything you want . If I do n't violate anyone then what is the beef ? If I do n't break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef ? The safe storage and handling of cannon , cannon propellant , and cannon ammo is well known . They can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others . BTW a cannon is not a weapon . It is considered a 'firework ' by the ATF . Ever see a civil war renactment ? Lots of cannons ? So yes having a cannon in your front yard does fly .""",DISAGREE,"""Since we will always draw the line someplace ,""","""You asked where the line should be drawn in regards to weapons ?"""

8496,"""Lack of a Natural Mechanism . Charles Darwin , in his Origin of Species , proposed Natural Selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today , both plant and animal . Darwin defines evolution as `` descent with modification. `` However , Natural Selection is known to be a conservative process , not a means of developing complexity from simplicity . Later , with our increased understanding of genetics , it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor . However , this is theoretical and controversial , since `` beneficial `` mutations have yet to be observed . In fact , scientists have only observed harmful , `` downward `` mutations thus far . Time Constraints . Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible , there needs to be an excessive ( if not infinite ) amount of time . For much of the 20th century , it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed . If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred , the age was pushed back in the textbooks . In 1905 , the earth was declared to be two billion years old . By 1970 , the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old , and by the 1990 's , the earth had become 4.6 billion years old .

8496,"""Lack of a Natural Mechanism . Charles Darwin , in his Origin of Species , proposed Natural Selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today , both plant and animal . Darwin defines evolution as `` descent with modification. `` However , Natural Selection is known to be a conservative process , not a means of developing complexity from simplicity . Later , with our increased understanding of genetics , it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor . However , this is theoretical and controversial , since `` beneficial `` mutations have yet to be observed . In fact , scientists have only observed harmful , `` downward `` mutations thus far . Time Constraints . Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible , there needs to be an excessive ( if not infinite ) amount of time . For much of the 20th century , it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed . If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred , the age was pushed back in the textbooks . In 1905 , the earth was declared to be two billion years old . By 1970 , the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old , and by the 1990 's , the earth had become 4.6 billion years old .

Sotomayor told the Senate Judiciary Committee that `` there is a right of privacy . The court has found it in various places in the Constitution. `` She said this right is stated in the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure and in the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection of the law . She declined to say pointblank if she agreed with the high court 's precedent on this volatile issue . Answering a question later from Sen.
