Humanity would n't be around if homosexuality were the standard , homosexuals would n't exist without heterosexuals . You may be looking for a more fundamental `` morality `` to my basis . I choose to validate my beliefs on science and years of living proof of heterosexualitie 's superiority , and when I mean hetero superiority I mean strict hetero adhearance , no socially unacceptable behavior being thrown in like `` cheating `` or `` rape `` .""","""Really ? If `` nature `` meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist , hmm . They would have been `` eliminated `` because heterosexuality is far superior . Think again . The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission ( bacteria dividing ) , asexual reproduction ( there goes your `` individual gratification argument ) , and zygotic reproduction . None of these things require sexes of any type . Even animals that have `` normal `` sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis , in which only a female is required to produce offspring ( turkeys and lizards do this ) . If homosexuality is n't natural or is inferior , then why do we see examples of it in nature . The bonobo ( closely related to the chimpanzee ) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild , and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor . Look , you ca n't say that one way of reproduction is `` the standard `` since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways . You also ca n't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is `` natural `` is valid . Also , you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a `` greater purpose `` . By implying that something has a purpose , you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology . If you want to assume that things were given `` purpose `` by some higher being , that 's fine , but you 'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument . In science , it is impossible to assume a purpose . For example , what is the purpose of a river ? To flow to the ocean ? To carve a canyon ? To carry sediment ? You can say what something is good at doing , or what it does , but you can not say what it was `` made `` for ( purpose ) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion . As for hetero and homosexuality , it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals . Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced ? So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or `` life `` , heterosexuality would be superior . But in the eyes of science and reason , your argument does n't hold water .""",DISAGREE,"""Nature does n't allow homosexual sex to create life""","""Really ?

C. 20560 1 November 1999 OPEN LETTER TO : Dr. Peter Raven , Secretary PRaven @ nas.org Committee for Research and Exploration National Geographic Society Washington , DC 20036 Dear Peter , I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society . With the publication of `` Feathers for T. rex ? `` by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue , National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic , unsubstantiated , tabloid journalism . But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature . Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas `` will later name `` the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis , there is no longer any need for him to do so . Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen `` accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon , `` the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic ( International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , Article 13a , i ) . This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists -- -that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist . Clearly , National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters . Sloan 's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that `` the Czerkases now plan to return it to China. `` In Washington , in June of 1996 , more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution , held at the Smithsonian Institution , were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation . There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message . Thus , at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband . Most , if not all , major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin . The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material , but has sensationalized , and is now exhibiting , an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally , administratively , and perhaps legally , off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions . Prior to the publication of the article `` Dinosaurs Take Wing `` in the July 1998 National Geographic , Lou Mazzatenta , the photographer for Sloan 's article , invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story . At that time , I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present , but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs . Sloan 's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that `` makes `` the news rather than reporting it . His bald statement that `` we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals `` is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists , so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing . This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology , which , of course , are never mentioned . More importantly , however , none of the structures illustrated in Sloan 's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers . Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact . The statement on page 103 that `` hollow , hairlike structures characterize protofeathers `` is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct , so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical . The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse , and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers . A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers , all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction . The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith . Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age -- -the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion . If Sloan 's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia , it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken . But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed , National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode .

1658,"""Thanks for your input .""","""Start with the largest most powerful calibur you can get and physically handle . Then consider : Practice = lots of ammo . Lots of ammo = cost increase with larger calibur . Practice = responsible gun owner . Training = responsible gun owner . Large calibur = ability to stop the attack quickly . Small calibur = less likely to exit your target and hit someone behind it . Well placed shots from a small calibur are superior to a large calibur that missed . As a bare minium take a training course that teaches you to handle low light conditions and drawing from a concealed holster . When you need it most are under conditions most favored by criminals , e.g . from behind , up close , in the dark , with suprise , or any combinations of them . A good instructor will also inform you of all the legal implications of having to defend yourself , the implications of comming to the aid of other people , the legal implications of defense on public and private property , etc . Personally I have made the decision that I WILL NOT help anyone in mortal danger whom I do not know . The legal implications if you are wrong are very drastic . You can never know the complete conditions of strangers and how they got to be in mortal danger , for all you know the person who just pulled out a gun may be an undercover cop . Thus I will only come to the aid for friends and family whom I know and thier business . My personal decision . The guys at the gun store are interested with selling you a pistol with the highest profit margin . Not the best tool for you . Only way to find out is with trigger time and carry time on the pistol . So you may have to horse trade a few times until you find the right one . My personal opinion ? A very small .38 revolver with more than one holster . Sometimes you need to carry it on your ankle , sometimes in your pocket , or sometimes on your hip . Plus a ton of ammo for practice . The ammo you spend on practice can soon cost more than the pistol . Los of inexpensive , reliable , and well built .38 's . Not a lot of fun to shoot , but hey , this is a tool with a very specific purpose . Of course of you can deal with more , by all means upgrade to more . Your not going to place a sniper shot between the eyes of a felon . Most likely you will need it at night , very quickly , and at a little longer than `` knife fighting distances `` . I use a .45 auto . I shoot a full size .45 for fun . Train with the full size .45 , but I carry a compact .45 . The compact has exactly the same shape in my hand as the large .45 , thus when I have to go the the small .45 quickly , it will retain the same operation and configuration in my hand as the large .45 . The large .45 has more fun factor , not a lot of fun to carry a big piece of steel on your hip all day . Plus I reload the .45 empties . The cost of a large calibur with reloading becomes as much as a smaller calibur when the ammo is store bought . The time spent reloading keeps me out of bars on week nights and my girlfriend more comforted . By the end of the day , after carrying even the compact .45 . I wish I had a small .38 . The most effecient solution I have seen was a friend who both had a .357 magnum and .22 of the same pistol . He practiced with the .22 pistol all he wanted and very cheaply . Shot the .357 magnum just enough to practice with the recoil . The .22 and .357 had exactly the same size , shape , and trigger pull .

They must be put to death ; their blood will be on their own heads. `` Romans 1:26-27 - `` Because of this , God gave them over to shameful lusts . Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones . In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another .

Kathleen McChesney , executive director of the Office of Child and Youth Protection of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , said the overwhelming majority of the accusations , which were made against 756 priests , concerned incidents that took place about 30 years ago .

Dr. McChesney said the costs to the church had exceeded $ 800 million since 1950 . Last year alone the costs from settlements , therapy for victims and offenders , and lawyers ' fees came to about $ 139.6 million , according to the report . The 1,092 new accusations of abuse were made by 1,083 people , mostly men . Last year the bishops released an analysis conducted by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York , based on figures from bishops and religious orders , that found 10,667 minors had allegedly been abused from 1950 to 2002 .

Kathleen McChesney , executive director of the Office of Child and Youth Protection of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , said the overwhelming majority of the accusations , which were made against 756 priests , concerned incidents that took place about 30 years ago . Twenty-two accusations of abuse were made by children in 2004 , and they were all turned over to the police , Dr. McChesney said . The findings were released on Friday by the national conference , which has hired independent auditors to assess the church 's response to the sex abuse scandals that exploded in 2002 . Dr. McChesney said the costs to the church had exceeded $ 800 million since 1950 . Last year alone the costs from settlements , therapy for victims and offenders , and lawyers ' fees came to about $ 139.6 million , according to the report . The 1,092 new accusations of abuse were made by 1,083 people , mostly men . Last year the bishops released an analysis conducted by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York , based on figures from bishops and religious orders , that found 10,667 minors had allegedly been abused from 1950 to 2002 . The actual number of victims will probably remain unknown because many people never come forward , Dr. McChesney said . '' We were n't surprised by the numbers because many people are still finding the courage to come forward , `` Dr. McChesney said , `` and the church is in a better place to accept those allegations. `` . . .""","""These two issues ( abortion and sexual abuse among priests ) are completely unrelated .

3657,"""It turns out that the fossil record is excellent evidence in favor of evolution . This because not only are transitional fossils found , that is fossils that have `` in between `` characteristics that link later groups with earlier groups , but these transitionals usually have precise characteristics that were predicted by the theory of evolution even before their discover .""","""Actually , you have been lied to here from my knowledge . The fossil record does not show `` in-between types `` . Darwin said that the absence of such intermediates was the `` most obvious and serious objection `` against his theory . Nearly 150 years later , Dr David Raup , the head of one of the great museums in America , said that the situation concerning missing links `` has n't changed much `` and that `` we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwins times. `` The Late Dr Colin Patterson was Senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History as well an being an evolutionist and a fossil expert . He wrote a significant book on evolution - but when someone asked him why he did not show any pictures of in-between forms in his book , he wrote the following : `` I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutinoary transitinos in my book . If I knew of any , fossil or living , I would certainly have included them . You suggest that an artist should be used to visualise such transformations , but where would he get the informatino from ? I could not , honestly , provide it , and if I were to leave it to artistic licence , would htat not mislead the reader ? I wrote the text of my book four years ago [ in the book he does talk of his belief in some transitions - my dialogue ] . If I were to write it now , I think the book would be rather different . Gradualism is a concept I believe in , not just because of Darwin 's authority , but because my understanding of genetics seems to demand it . Yet [ famous fossil expert stephen J . ] Gould and the American Museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitinoal fossils . As a palaeontologist myself , I am much occupied with the philosophical problems of identifying ancestral forms in the fossil record . You say that I should at least `` show a photo of the fossil form which each type of organism was derived `` . I will lay it on teh line - there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument. `` Patterson came under fire from fellow evolutionists for having made this and similar candid admissinos , and attempted to soften the remarks retrospectively . However , the language is clear and unmistakable . Stephen Jay Gould , evolutionist said this : `` The lack of transitional fossils is the trade secret of palaeontology `` . All quotes came from `` The Revised Quote Book `` . You interestingly bring up human evolution . Human evolution is blank and filled with a tonne of holes that would sink the Titanic . Let us go through the basic evolutionary candidates : * Australopithecines ( Lucy fossil type ) : - Dr Charles Oxnard is one of a growing number of evolutionist anatomists who have examined vast numbers of measurements by computerized multivariate analysis ( an objective method that does not depend on preconceived beliefs about ancestry ) , do not believ that these creatuers are human ancestors . He states that although initally it was though that they were human-like or at least intermediate between apes and humans , the reality is that they `` differ more from both humans and African apes than do these two living groups from each other . THe australopithecines are unique. `` Recent CAT scans of the bony labyrinth which once housed their organ of balance have shown conclusively that they did not habitually walk upright , as many still insist . * Homo Habblis : - Many scientists ( evolutionary scientists included ) are now recognising that Habblis is a waste bin of two or more creatures , and hence , is an invalid category . Even so , the CAT scans have determined that Habblis was less bipedal than Australopithecines . So we are actually `` de-evolving `` if you will . * Homo Erectus and Neandertals : - Once again , CAT scans have shown that Erectus and Neandertals walked up right just like us . They would be able to run , hop , skip , jump , etc , and do all the things that we do today . Many scientists now classify erectus and neandertals as `` true humans `` . And it has been known that Neandertal types had been living at the same time as `` modern `` types . Tools found on an Indonesian island in associatino with stegodon ( an extinct elephant ) remains have cause evolutionist Dr Alan Thorne to suggest that these so-called `` pre-human ancestors `` had seafaring skills and technology . As far back as 1993 he said , `` They 're not [ i.e . should n't be called ] Homo erecus , they 're people `` . This quote came from the Australian , 19 August 1993 . If one uses the evolutionists ' own timescales and criteria for classification and plots all `` hominid `` fossil discoveries on a chart , it will readily be seen that the idea of any evolutionary sequence is a shambles . ( M. Lubenow , `` Bones of Contention `` ) . I found it interesting that you got your information from talkorigins.com . They totally do not know what they are talking about . In one article that I saw regarding SNRs they totally changed the scientific evidence to suit their own theory , as for one , the article was not written by an educated person , nor did it have any references - unlike the article on SNRs that was written by Answers in Genesis . Many of their arguments , like the one on your link can be easliy refuted . Other articles employ what is known as the `` straw man `` argument tactic , i.e . using an argument that can be easily refuted and one that is not held by anyone . If evolution is true , than we should expect to find millions and millions of fossils of in-between forms , right ? Well , the truth is , we do n't . Some evolutionists claim there are some - maybe a handful - of such in-between fossil types ( highly , highly , highly debatable ) . Other leading experts have rejected soe or all of these . What is not well known is that the interesting fossil creature Archaeopteryx , often used as an example of a transitional form between reptiles and birds shows none of the crucial transitinoal structures which would strongly argue for `` transitional `` status . The feathers are fully formed , and the wings are proper wings . It has the backward-facing claw and curved feet characteristic of perching birds .

4816,"""2 . By HELEN EPSTEIN EVEN as the United States Agency for International Development sends hundreds of millions of dollars worth of food to developing countries , a strange but important nutritional problem is being overlooked : The children of women who suffer from severe stress and poverty sometimes seem to give up and refuse to eat . Studies suggest that this stems from maternal detachment Â— the breakdown of emotional connection between traumatized mothers and their children . ..... Sally Grantham-McGregor , a child health researcher working in Jamaica , demonstrated that teaching poor mothers the basic techniques of mothering Â— holding and playing , and communicating with smiles , gestures and questions Â— could help their ailing children achieve remarkable developmental gains . And these gains were much greater than those that could have been achieved with food and medical care alone . Today , Unicef and the World Health Organization agree that counseling should be an important part of food aid programs . Once feeding programs are in place , it costs very little to train community health workers . One organization , Play Therapy Africa , which runs feeding and counseling centers in Ethiopia , is training aid workers in these methods in 50 centers . The one-time expense of $ 278,000 Â— the cost of training and monitoring the health workers Â— is a pittance compared with the millions of dollars spent on food alone . Unfortunately , most aid economists overlook counseling . When the journal Lancet recently reviewed strategies to reduce malnutrition , these methods werenÂ ’ t mentioned at all . Vulnerable children require more than food and medicine ; they need affection . To nurture them , we need to nurture the mothers on whom their lives depend .""","""WouldnÂ ’ t it be wonderful if every woman in the world didnÂ ’ t have to be so alone , without a single helping hand , when she becomes a mother ?""",AGREE,"""By HELEN EPSTEIN EVEN as the United States Agency for International Development sends hundreds of millions of dollars""","""WouldnÂ ’ t it be wonderful if every woman in the world didnÂ ’ t have to be so alone"""

5320,"""A lot of garbage has been bandied about concerning the emotional trauma a woman suffers after she has had an abortion . There is no substantive , unbiased research on this topic but a cursory sampling seems to indicate that women who report great emotional trauma after an abortion were already mentally unbalanced , possibly subject to depression or dramatic mood swings or other mental disturbances prior to becoming pregnant and having an abortion . I am inclined to believe that such emotionally-disturbed women are incapable of making a rational choice in many instances and they probably would have suffered enormous emotional consequences whatever choice they made . But , if one could survey a sizable group of women who were in command of their faculties and capable of making good and reasonable choices , what if these women experienced emotional trauma and greatly regretted their decisions . My first question to them would be , `` Why exactly did you choose abortion ? `` I would like to know if they were forced by poverty to make such a choice , thereby not having a free choice . Or , if they were forced because of the stigma against unwed motherhood and illegitimate birth , particularly if they came from a very religious household , to have an abortion to avoid shame both for themselves and for their families . Again , not a free choice . Another factor would be if a woman were pursuing a very desired career and having a child or being disabled by pregnancy would injure her professional prospects . The workplace does not look kindly upon the demands of pregnancy , giving birth , being responsible for children . America is not a very family-friendly nation and women who are responsible for the primary care of children are severely penalized for having those responsibilities . Again , these women do not have a free choice in the matter .""","""Just to provide some evidence of how incredibly shallow your liberal justifications and imaginings are , here 's some light reading for you simone . It 's from something called a book . CHAPTER 9 HEALTH MORE SPECIFICALLY , MENTAL HEALTH In discussing abortion , and abortion for the motherÂ ’ s health , it is absolutely crucial to know what `` health `` means , legally and in practice , regarding abortion . '' Health `` was defined in detail by the U.S. Supreme Court . The Court said that abortion could be performed : `` . . . in the light of all factors Â— physical , emotion-al , psychological , familial , and the womanÂ ’ s age Â— relevant to the well being of the patient . All these factors may relate to health. `` Roe vs. Wade , January 22 , 1973 And in its companion decision , `` Maternity or additional offspring may force upon the woman a distressful life and future . Psychological harm may be imminent . Mental and physical health may be taxed by childcare . There is also the distress for all concerned associated with the unwanted child , and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable , psychologically or otherwise , to care for it. `` Doe vs. Bolton , January 22 , 1973 44 In a concurring opinion , Justice Douglas further elaborated what `` health `` meant when , in law , it related to abortion . He detailed if she had to : `` endure the discomforts of pregnancy ; to incur the pain , higher mortality rate , and aftereffects of childbirth ; to abandon educational plans ; to sustain loss of income ; to forego the satisfactions of careers ; to tax further mental and physical health in providing childcare , and in some cases , to bear the lifelong stigma of unwed motherhood. `` Roe vs. Wade , January 22 , 1973 This definition of `` health `` has been adopted internationally . As a result , in any nation , if abortion is al-lowed for the womanÂ ’ s `` health , `` that country permits abortion on demand unless other aspects of its laws add restrictions . The World Health Organization of the United Nations defined it as including social , emotional and economic well being of the woman as defined by the woman herself . LetÂ ’ s narrow it down to mental health , in the psychological sense , and askÂ–are there mental health reasons for abortion ? No ! The woman with mental health problems is far more likely to experience post-abortion emotional and psychological problems than a more stable woman .

Thus , the very women for whom legal abortion is considered justified on psychiatric grounds are the ones who have the highest risk of post-abortion psychiatric disorders. `` Then `` mental illness `` as a reason for abortion is just an excuse ? Precisely . What about psychological problems after abortion ? When your authors wrote Handbook on Abortion in 1971 , there were a few murmurings about post-abortion problems , but little was known . We then saw the negatives as mostly physical . When we wrote Abortion : Questions & amp ; Answers in 1985 , physical damage , while still a major problem , was given less emphasis , and negative psychological aftermath was being seriously investigated . With the publication of this book , far more is known about what is now called Post Abortion Syndrome which clearly is a post traumatic stress syndrome . A Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome ? Yes . This type of problem was first seen in large numbers in Vietnam veterans , but did not manifest it-self until a decade after they returned . The same ten-year delay has been evident with abortion . T. Keane , Vietnam Vets Trauma disorder level at 15 % , Am . Med . News , L. Abraham , Dec. 2 , 1988 , p. 2 What is Post Abortion Syndrome ( PAS ) ? Many women are very ambivalent about getting aborted but do go ahead . Those around her told her ( and she told herself ) that it wouldnÂ ’ t bother her . When symptoms occur , she tells herself it canÂ ’ t be the abortion causing them , and then into play come her two major psychological defense mechanisms : Repression and Denial . For some this works successfully . For others it shades off to manageable distress , to severe and life-changing upset and even to suicide . There is a delay ? Yes ! Her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief . Then , with repression and denial , she avoids the problem , usually for years Â—5 years is common , 10 or 20 not unusual . But then , for some , the negative feelings bubble up and break through . Often the precipitating event is : she has a baby , or a close friend or relative has a baby that she has close contact with . She finds out she is sterile , or other life-changing events . What are the symptoms of PAS ? Guilt is ever present in many guises , along with regret , remorse , shame , lowered self-esteem , insomnia , dreams and nightmares , flash backs , anniversary reactions . There often is hostility , and even hatred , toward men . This can include her husband , and she may be-come sexually dysfunctional . Crying , despair and depression are usual , even at times with suicide attempts . Recourse to alcohol or drugs to mask the pain is frequent , sometimes leading to sexual promiscuity . There is also a numbing and coldness in place of more normal warmth and maternal tenderness . Is this due to religious guilt feelings ? Perhaps in some it is a factor , but most women re-ported on in the early studies were unchurched at the time . Perhaps they had seen pictures of fetuses ? Again , not most . Most did not know `` it `` was a `` baby `` when they aborted . But IÂ ’ ve heard that the American Psychological Association says that PAS doesnÂ ’ t exist . This group has been strongly pro-abortion , and this definitely colors its thinking . But during the past decade or more , there have been dozens of national conferences on PAS . There are many professional articles and about 15 books adding more and more authentication to its existence and knowledge about it . Further , every one of the almost 4,000 pro-life pregnancy help centers in the U.S. now has found that an increasing percentage of their time is now devoted to treating PAS women . But so many studies deny PAS . True , and most are invalid for two reasons : ( 1 ) Timing : Most studies have investigated feelings for only a few weeks or months post abortion when she is still feeling relief that her problem is gone . Since the delay before PAS symptoms intrude is often 5 years or more , these studies are invalid . ( 2 ) Superficiality : Her repression and denial push this deep into her subconsciousness . If the survey is done by questionnaire or single interview , she routinely denies problems . These studies are invalid . Only by lengthy psychological testing and counseling can she often admit to some symptoms , much less tie them to the abortion she so desperately wants to forget . You mean most studies miss PAS ? But most polls show few emotional problems Â— only a sense of relief ! Yes , but `` What women really feel at the deepest level about abortion is very different from what they say in reply to questionnaires. `` A Canadian study polled a group of women who had previously completed a questionnaire in which they denied having problems from an abortion . One half of this group was randomly chosen for in-depth psychotherapy. `` What emerged from psychotherapy was in sharp contrast [ to the questionnaires ] , even when the woman had rationally considered abortion to be inevitable , the only course of action. `` It was demonstrated that the conscious , rationalized decision for an abortion can co-exist with profound rejection of it at the deepest level . Despite surface appearances , abortion leaves behind deeper feelings `` invariably of intense pain , involving bereavement and a sense of identification with the foetus. `` I.

Then , in a Buddhist Temple , rites of sorrow and reconciliation are carried out . Does abortion have any negative effects on her other children ? In some cases a definite `` Survivor Syndrome `` has been demonstrated . Children usually know that mother is pregnant . They also know when she `` gets unpregnant. `` This may cause SurvivorÂ ’ s Syndrome , similar to that of Jews who survived the holocaust . It is an irrational but real guilt at `` why was I saved and why were they killed. `` Dr. Ney has written about this .

It 's from something called a book . CHAPTER 9 HEALTH MORE SPECIFICALLY , MENTAL HEALTH In discussing abortion , and abortion for the motherÂ ’ s health , it is absolutely crucial to know what `` health `` means , legally and in practice , regarding abortion . '' Health `` was defined in detail by the U.S. Supreme Court . The Court said that abortion could be performed : `` . . . in the light of all factors Â— physical , emotion-al , psychological , familial , and the womanÂ ’ s age Â— relevant to the well being of the patient . All these factors may relate to health. `` Roe vs. Wade , January 22 , 1973 And in its companion decision , `` Maternity or additional offspring may force upon the woman a distressful life and future . Psychological harm may be imminent . Mental and physical health may be taxed by childcare . There is also the distress for all concerned associated with the unwanted child , and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable , psychologically or otherwise , to care for it. `` Doe vs. Bolton , January 22 , 1973 44 In a concurring opinion , Justice Douglas further elaborated what `` health `` meant when , in law , it related to abortion .

Again , these women do not have a free choice in the matter .""","""Just to provide some evidence of how incredibly shallow your liberal justifications and imaginings are , here 's some light reading for you simone . It 's from something called a book . CHAPTER 9 HEALTH MORE SPECIFICALLY , MENTAL HEALTH In discussing abortion , and abortion for the motherÂ ’ s health , it is absolutely crucial to know what `` health `` means , legally and in practice , regarding abortion . '' Health `` was defined in detail by the U.S. Supreme Court . The Court said that abortion could be performed : `` . . . in the light of all factors Â— physical , emotion-al , psychological , familial , and the womanÂ ’ s age Â— relevant to the well being of the patient . All these factors may relate to health. `` Roe vs. Wade , January 22 , 1973 And in its companion decision , `` Maternity or additional offspring may force upon the woman a distressful life and future . Psychological harm may be imminent . Mental and physical health may be taxed by childcare . There is also the distress for all concerned associated with the unwanted child , and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable , psychologically or otherwise , to care for it. `` Doe vs. Bolton , January 22 , 1973 44 In a concurring opinion , Justice Douglas further elaborated what `` health `` meant when , in law , it related to abortion . He detailed if she had to : `` endure the discomforts of pregnancy ; to incur the pain , higher mortality rate , and aftereffects of childbirth ; to abandon educational plans ; to sustain loss of income ; to forego the satisfactions of careers ; to tax further mental and physical health in providing childcare , and in some cases , to bear the lifelong stigma of unwed motherhood. `` Roe vs. Wade , January 22 , 1973 This definition of `` health `` has been adopted internationally . As a result , in any nation , if abortion is al-lowed for the womanÂ ’ s `` health , `` that country permits abortion on demand unless other aspects of its laws add restrictions . The World Health Organization of the United Nations defined it as including social , emotional and economic well being of the woman as defined by the woman herself . LetÂ ’ s narrow it down to mental health , in the psychological sense , and askÂ–are there mental health reasons for abortion ? No ! The woman with mental health problems is far more likely to experience post-abortion emotional and psychological problems than a more stable woman . Four classic references here are these : `` Women with a history of psychiatric disturbance were three times as likely to have some psychiatric disturbance `` after an abortion as others who had no such history. `` E. Greenglass , `` Abortion & amp ; Psychiatric Disturbance , `` Canadian Psych . Assn . Jour. , vol . 21 , no . 7 , Nov. 1976 , pp . 453-459 Dr. Charles Ford and his associates at UCLA reported the same finding . '' The more serious the psychiatric diagnosis , the less beneficial was the abortion. `` C. Ford et al. , `` Abortion , Is It a Therapeutic Procedure in Psychiatry ? `` JAMA , vol . 218 , no . 8 , Nov. 22 , 1971 , pp . 1173-1178 `` The more severely ill the psychiatric patient , the worse is her post-abortion psychiatric state. `` E. Sandberg , `` Psychology of Abortion `` In Comprehensive Handbook of Psychiatry , 3rd ed . Kaplan & amp ; Friedman Publishers , 1980 All of these support the original official statement of the World Health Organization in 1970 : `` Serious mental disorders arise more often in women with previous mental problems . Thus , the very women for whom legal abortion is considered justified on psychiatric grounds are the ones who have the highest risk of post-abortion psychiatric disorders. `` Then `` mental illness `` as a reason for abortion is just an excuse ? Precisely . What about psychological problems after abortion ? When your authors wrote Handbook on Abortion in 1971 , there were a few murmurings about post-abortion problems , but little was known . We then saw the negatives as mostly physical . When we wrote Abortion : Questions & amp ; Answers in 1985 , physical damage , while still a major problem , was given less emphasis , and negative psychological aftermath was being seriously investigated . With the publication of this book , far more is known about what is now called Post Abortion Syndrome which clearly is a post traumatic stress syndrome . A Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome ? Yes . This type of problem was first seen in large numbers in Vietnam veterans , but did not manifest it-self until a decade after they returned . The same ten-year delay has been evident with abortion . T. Keane , Vietnam Vets Trauma disorder level at 15 % , Am . Med . News , L. Abraham , Dec. 2 , 1988 , p. 2 What is Post Abortion Syndrome ( PAS ) ? Many women are very ambivalent about getting aborted but do go ahead . Those around her told her ( and she told herself ) that it wouldnÂ ’ t bother her . When symptoms occur , she tells herself it canÂ ’ t be the abortion causing them , and then into play come her two major psychological defense mechanisms : Repression and Denial . For some this works successfully . For others it shades off to manageable distress , to severe and life-changing upset and even to suicide . There is a delay ? Yes ! Her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief . Then , with repression and denial , she avoids the problem , usually for years Â—5 years is common , 10 or 20 not unusual . But then , for some , the negative feelings bubble up and break through . Often the precipitating event is : she has a baby , or a close friend or relative has a baby that she has close contact with . She finds out she is sterile , or other life-changing events . What are the symptoms of PAS ? Guilt is ever present in many guises , along with regret , remorse , shame , lowered self-esteem , insomnia , dreams and nightmares , flash backs , anniversary reactions . There often is hostility , and even hatred , toward men . This can include her husband , and she may be-come sexually dysfunctional . Crying , despair and depression are usual , even at times with suicide attempts . Recourse to alcohol or drugs to mask the pain is frequent , sometimes leading to sexual promiscuity . There is also a numbing and coldness in place of more normal warmth and maternal tenderness . Is this due to religious guilt feelings ? Perhaps in some it is a factor , but most women re-ported on in the early studies were unchurched at the time . Perhaps they had seen pictures of fetuses ? Again , not most . Most did not know `` it `` was a `` baby `` when they aborted . But IÂ ’ ve heard that the American Psychological Association says that PAS doesnÂ ’ t exist . This group has been strongly pro-abortion , and this definitely colors its thinking . But during the past decade or more , there have been dozens of national conferences on PAS . There are many professional articles and about 15 books adding more and more authentication to its existence and knowledge about it . Further , every one of the almost 4,000 pro-life pregnancy help centers in the U.S. now has found that an increasing percentage of their time is now devoted to treating PAS women . But so many studies deny PAS . True , and most are invalid for two reasons : ( 1 ) Timing : Most studies have investigated feelings for only a few weeks or months post abortion when she is still feeling relief that her problem is gone . Since the delay before PAS symptoms intrude is often 5 years or more , these studies are invalid . ( 2 ) Superficiality : Her repression and denial push this deep into her subconsciousness . If the survey is done by questionnaire or single interview , she routinely denies problems . These studies are invalid . Only by lengthy psychological testing and counseling can she often admit to some symptoms , much less tie them to the abortion she so desperately wants to forget . You mean most studies miss PAS ? But most polls show few emotional problems Â— only a sense of relief ! Yes , but `` What women really feel at the deepest level about abortion is very different from what they say in reply to questionnaires. `` A Canadian study polled a group of women who had previously completed a questionnaire in which they denied having problems from an abortion . One half of this group was randomly chosen for in-depth psychotherapy. `` What emerged from psychotherapy was in sharp contrast [ to the questionnaires ] , even when the woman had rationally considered abortion to be inevitable , the only course of action. `` It was demonstrated that the conscious , rationalized decision for an abortion can co-exist with profound rejection of it at the deepest level . Despite surface appearances , abortion leaves behind deeper feelings `` invariably of intense pain , involving bereavement and a sense of identification with the foetus. `` I. Kent et al. , `` Emotional Sequelae of Elective Abortion , `` British College of Med . Jour. , vol . 20 , no . 4 , April 1978 I. Kent , `` Abortion Has Profound Impact , `` Family Practice News , June 1980 , p. 80 Are there valid studies ? Yes , and two meta-analyses : James Rogers , who carefully examined over 400 published studies , pointed to the almost universal use of `` poor methodology and research design `` and `` grossly substandard power characteristics. `` He concluded that `` the question of psychological sequelae of abortion is not closed. `` J. Rogers et al. , `` Validity of Existing Controlled Studies Examining the Psychological Sequelae of Abortion , `` Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith , vol . 39 , no . 1 , Mar . 1987 , pp . 20-29 49 Another concurred that existing research is methodologically flawed and that women who abort show more negative outcomes than those who deliver their babies . E. Posavac et al. , `` Some Problems . . . Psychological Effects of Abortion , `` Psychology & amp ; Health , 5 , 13-23 How about specific studies ?

Does it ever lead to suicide ? Suicide is rare among pregnant women , but much more common after induced abortion . It is never re-ported under maternal mortality from abortion , of course , even though it is causative . '' The suicide rate after an abortion was three times the general suicide rate and six times that associated with birth .... the rate for women following a live birth was 5.9 per 100,000 ; following miscarriage 18.1 ; following abortion 34.7. `` They note that women frequently get short term `` post-natal blues after having a baby , but that this rarely translates into suicide , and that the initial stress of having a child is transitional , the over-all effect having a positive effect on womenÂ ’ s health. `` M. Gissler , Abortion/Suicide Link , Br . Med . J. , Dec. 6 , 1996 Then it is rare among pregnant women ? In Abortion : Questions & amp ; Answers your authors de-tail 5 studies clearly showing this . One comment may suffice : `` The fetus in utero must be a protective mechanism . Perhaps women are reluctant to take another life with them when they do this. `` How about after abortion ? In the above book your authors also give the findings of Suiciders Anonymous , and that : suicide post-abortion is several times more common than post-delivery . British Medical Jour. , 1996 What of Psychosis afterwards ? This has not changed since Dr. M. SimsÂ ’ original paper . He stated that , compared to post-delivery disturbances , post-abortion psychoses are much more serious , last longer , and are more likely to recur . They are more often the `` hard `` cases . M. Sim , `` Abortion and the Psychiatrist , `` British Med . Jour. , vol . 2 , 1963 , pp . 145-148 How about an example from a non-Christian culture ? In Japan , where abortion has been legal and accepted for over four decades , a common custom is to conduct Mizuyo Kuyo services in honor of the god Jizo . This god has been made the patron saint of infants who died of starvation , abortion , or infanticide . Small baby statues , in his honor , are bought and dressed . Then , in a Buddhist Temple , rites of sorrow and reconciliation are carried out . Does abortion have any negative effects on her other children ? In some cases a definite `` Survivor Syndrome `` has been demonstrated . Children usually know that mother is pregnant . They also know when she `` gets unpregnant. `` This may cause SurvivorÂ ’ s Syndrome , similar to that of Jews who survived the holocaust . It is an irrational but real guilt at `` why was I saved and why were they killed. `` Dr. Ney has written about this . Dr. Edward Sheridan of Georgetown University has observed also a fear and mistrust of the mother . Originally , a small child , sensing a siblingÂ ’ s arrival , doesnÂ ’ t welcome it . '' When the baby suddenly disappears , the frightened child may get a warped sense of his own power to Â ‘ will people away.Â ’ Or , if he knows that his mother was an active agent in doing away with the sibling , he begins to fear her. `` A simple explanation of this was published in : L. Bond , `` The Surviving Sibling , `` NatÂ ’ l RTL News , Sept. 25 , 1986 . It is also closely associated with child abuse : Dr. Phillip Ney , Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Christ Church , New Zealand , and of later at the University of Calgary , Canada , while still at the University of British Columbia , published a widely read study of this . His analysis clearly pointed to the fact that abortion ( and its acceptance of the violence of killing the unborn ) lowered a parentÂ ’ s psychic resistance to violence and abuse of the born . P. Ney , `` Relationship Between Abortion & amp ; Child Abuse , `` Canada Jour . Psychiatry , vol . 24 , 1979 , pp . 610-620 Is there treatment for PAS ? Yes , but it is not easy . We first must note that only a few doctors are sensitized to the necessary dynamics of treatment . Specifically , most psychiatrists and psychologists arenÂ ’ t much help , nor are psychotropic drugs . This requires a gradual healing process , and during it she must have ongoing close emotional support from one or several people who do not have to be trained professionals . As of the late 1990s , the place to start is your pro-life pregnancy help center . They can either work with her themselves and/or will know who can . Basically , there are five steps to the healing process : ( 1 ) Counter the denial . Bring this back into her consciousness and admit she was a party to killing her own baby . She must grieve over her lost child Â— tears , mourning as for another loved one . ( 3 ) Seek Divine forgiveness . This was not expected but seems essential for almost every woman . ( 4 ) Forgive others . Difficult , again , but some of this is needed to complete the healing and get rid of her long repressed anger . ( 5 ) Forgive herself . Not many get this far , but those who do have real inner peace . What is absolutely crucial at every step in the above is compassionate empathy , support and understanding from one or more persons around her . J. Willke , P.A.S .

5816,"""Excerpts from a recent report : `` It has been claimed that in the United States , 'guns are used for defensive purposes about five times as often as they are used for crimes'.1,2 This claim is made even though the criminal chooses both the time and place of the crime , most households donÂ ’ t have guns , and very few of the individuals who own guns are carrying at any time ... `` After controlling for other aspects of the surveys , these surveys indicate that criminal gun use is far more common that self-defense gun use . For example , in May 2000 , a Washington Post national random-digit dial survey asked 'Not counting military service , have you ever been threatened with a gun or shot at ? ' Twenty-three percent ( 23 % ) said yes . In that same month ( May 2000 ) , a Gallup national random-digit dial survey asked 'Not including military combat , have you ever used a gun to defend yourself either by firing it or threatening to fire it ? ' Seven percent ( 7 % ) of respondents said yes .... `` So how can anyone claim that there are more self-defense gun uses than criminal gun uses ? They do so by comparing different types of surveys . They compare the results of Box B with Box C !

6324,"""Seven thousand two hundred thirty-four . If Chicago is your home , that number tells you something about your city , and police say it 's not necessarily good . As CBS 2 's Kristyn Hartman reports , there have been 7,234 guns recovered or confiscated by Chicago Police so far this year . When you think about it , that 's about one gun for every 400 people , in a city with an ordinance that prohibits them . Chicagoan Robert Herbert hears gunshots all the time in his neighborhood . He says lots of people have them . '' All the time , every day , yesterday , the day before yesterday , `` Herbert said . Police are finding some of the guns . '' So far year to date , there 's been seven thousand , two hundred and thirty four firearms recovered in Chicago , `` said Deputy Chicago Police Chief Nick Roti . Roti says the number , which is up , really tells the tale of two cities . One is the mean streets story . '' Guns are found in parks , under porches , `` Roti said . The other is the safer streets story . '' The good news is we 're recovering the guns , `` he said . '' I think people are getting fed up with public violence , It 's evidenced by reporting of it. `` Roti says increased search warrants net guns . Buybacks , patrol stops and putting cops in the right places also net guns . Police say most of what they recover comes from south of the Stevenson Expressway , generally the South Side of Chicago , in neighborhoods like Englewood . There , gangs , drugs and firearms all seem to go together . Herbert is happy with the work , but he fears the guns are replaced as quickly as they are removed . If it were legal , he says he 'd have one for protection . When asked if there is a justification for carrying a weapon , Roti said : `` Not really for me to say . It 's against the law in Chicago. `` National Rifle Association Legislative Liaison Todd Vandermyde said if people were allowed to have a weapon for self-defense , it would `` absolutely `` deter crime . '' But Chicago has put its citizens in victimization mode , because they have n't allowed them the use of self-defense , `` he said . '' The only guys carrying guns on the streets are the bad guys. `` The city 's 27-year-old handgun ban is under court challenge . Meanwhile , police hope to challenge street violence with a provision waiting for Gov . Pat Quinn 's signature . It would mean gang members caught with guns would spend a mandatory three years behind bars . The ordinance would be named after Alex Valadez , a Chicago Police Officer who was killed .""","""So Chicago has a total handgun ban , no exceptions for anyone except politicians with influence .

That 's why same gender marriage has never been respected or honored by the larger community Op , because it can never fulfill the reason that marriage and families were originally formed . And even though past civilizations have accepted gay people as a real , and even vital part of the community in some Societies , in no other generation in the history of the World has same sex marriage ever been considered as a good or positive option for the improvement of the Society .""","""So now your true colors finally show Archie . Now we see the mind numbing dogma that has been persecuting gays for years . And now that we have a voice , now that we have finally said enough to your radical incoherent mind numbing tirade of slanderous bull , you have obviously gone into a mode of severe mental meltdown . Comparing gays equal rights to slavery is as assnine as any thing you have said on this forum thus far . You saying that unless we were in bondage and were slaves you would REFUSE us equal rights of any kind ! Unless your forgeting it is people of your distinct odd calibur full of pointing blame , ridicule , and judging others when they dont have the backbone to judge themselves in the mirror and instead take their frustrations out on others and target them due to self weakness and loathing to incure a disgusting self satisfaction and glee in the suffering of others , that are the basis for all the injustices done to those who have been affected by the horror and torment of persecution due to belief or difference than others . Sorry everyone but this is just too much for me . The nerve of some people !

But a zygote can split into two - to form monozygotic , or 'identical ' , twins . Before splitting , it is one 'individual ' . Afterwards , it is two . Where has the extra individual come from ? Given that the split can happen up to 15 days after fertilisation , when was the start of that individuals life ? Thirdly : In contrast to identical twins , consider a chimera organism . A chimera is made up of cells containing one of two different strands of human DNA - they are formed when two fertilised eggs or early embryos collide and become one embryo , which then goes on to be a single human being . Given that the single individual was created by the merging of two different individuals ( by your definition ) , when was the biological start of their life ?""","""I 'll take these questions ( one at a time ) in the other thread .""",DISAGREE,"""speaking , a human individual 's life begins at conception - contrast to identical twins , consider a chimera organism""","""other thread"""

I will bet that simone will choose to COMPLETELY IGNORE MY POST because I am removing all lines of dishonest `` logic switching `` .

If this is so , you ca n't call guns bad . This determination can not be admitted on the path simone has chosen . Therefore , since simone 's agenda insists on the inherent evilness of an object ( a gun ) there MUST be some logical deviation to explain why these `` evil `` items are not `` evil `` when used by police .

In the end , there was very , very little difference in the stance between the two candidates regarding gay rights . The marriage amendment was the only difference , but to be fair , gay activists should say that Kerry saw them no more 'human ' than Bush . Unfortunately for gay people , they have been taken and cheated by the Democratic party . The most they have gotten is token words and occassional promises that never really take place . But in the debates , Kerry was just as unappoving of gay marriage as Bush was . So why would gay rights activists overwhelmingly support Kerry and the Democratic party ? Ca n't they see they have been sold a rotten bill of goods ? Democrats have been no more helpful in the last 20 years -- Clinton himself would not veto DOMA , signing it instead . It is difficult to take gay rights groups seriously when they throw their enthusiastic support at only Democrat canididates who are practically no different than Republican ones on the issue . Frankly , it smacks of partisanship and backroom politics . Gay people are the losers . Does that mean that gay people would be better off supporting Republicans ? Not necessarily . But at least a little less blind political allegiance would help . At this point , it would seem that even if the Republican party ran a gay candidate who supported gay marriage enthusiastically , gay rights groups would still endorse the Democrat . Yes , it 's THAT bad .""","""I think the Democrats are generally seen as the lesser of two evils . Your point about gay rights groups perhaps endorsing a Democrat out of blind party loyalty over a pro- gay marriage Republican is an interesting point . Perhaps the answer is for those in all parties who are gay , to be more aggressive in promoting their equality .

9928,"""GEOLOGY : The Calibration of Ediacaran Time Alan J. Kaufman * More than a century ago , the last great geological period was formally ratified by an international committee . This was the final rocky step in the subdivision of deep time based on the evolutionary progression of animal fossils . However , recent years have seen the identification of an older and tumultuous new interval , the Ediacaran Period , during which Earth 's earliest soft-bodied organisms emerged in the oceans . This interval was recently ratified ( 1 ) , underscoring advances in the absolute dating ( 2-6 ) and worldwide correlation of geological strata that were deposited in isolated basins before true animals exploded onto the scene in the succeeding Cambrian Period . On page 95 of this issue , Condon et al . ( 7 ) present precise age constraints for the Ediacaran Period . The authors have analyzed volcanic dust in two key depositional layers in the Doushantuo Formation of southern China . Their radiometric dates provide important insights into the rates of geological and evolutionary processes . The first layer , with an age of about 635 million years , is at the base of the new interval , whereas the second , at about 550 million years , may constrain the age of an environmental disaster ( 8-10 ) that is closely associated with the rapid diversification of the Ediacara biota ( see the figure ) that lend their name to the new Period . http : //www.sciencemag.org/content/vo ... m/59-1-med.gif Figure 1 Early animals ? A pile of three-dimensionally preserved casts of the soft-bodied Ediacaran organism Ernietta from ~545 million-year-old sediments in the Nama Group of southern Namibia . The scale bar corresponds to 15 cm . Convention previously focused on the evolutionary first appearance of a specific fossil or assemblage to define the beginning of new geological periods . In contrast , the beginning of the Ediacaran period is defined by the base of a marine carbonate rock , which formed in southern Australia in the aftermath of a distinctive and potentially global ice age ( 11 , 12 ) . Equivalent glacial rocks occur immediately beneath similar carbonates at the base of the Doushantuo Formation . In the area studied by Condon et al. , the new ages constrain the Doushantuo Formation , which represents most of the Ediacaran Period , to some 85 million years -- a remarkably long interval for only about 100 m of rock . This observation begs the question : How much time may be missing in Ediacaran strata from southern China ? In the absence of dates between the two radiometric tie points , one must consider two possibilities : Either the sediments accumulated continuously , albeit slowly ( some two orders of magnitude more slowly than in similar environments of the same age ) , or there are breaks in time ( hiatuses or unconformities ) hidden within the poorly exposed layers . On the basis of limited physical data , Condon et al . suggest the presence of two such unconformities in their study area near the Yangtze Gorges . The duration of these stratigraphic breaks with respect to the environmental anomaly -- reflecting a dramatic change in the cycling of carbon on Earth 's surface -- and subsequent biological innovations form the cornerstone of their conclusions , and deserve closer examination . Spectacular fossil animal embryos ( 13 , 14 ) of great evolutionary importance are found at Weng'an ( some 375 km to the southwest of the authors ' study area ) , where the Doushantuo Formation accumulated closer to the shoreline and records only a single surface of unconformity . In such nearshore environments , oceanic sediments are often exposed above sea level , resulting in the removal of underlying sediments and hence the erasure of some fraction of geological time . Which of the two hiatal surfaces from the deeper-water sections at the Yangtze Gorges correlates to the single unconformity at Weng'an ? The data are more equivocal than presented by Condon et al. , and the choice carries important evolutionary consequences . At the Yangtze Gorges , the extraordinary carbon cycle anomaly recorded in marine carbonates near the top of the Doushanto Formation is truncated by the uppermost unconformity . Condon et al . suggest that there is little time missing across the surface , thereby preserving a causal relation between the environmental perturbation and the rapid diversification of Ediacara organisms and associated faunas around 550 million years ago . However , correlation of this surface and the intervening sediments back to Weng'an tells another story . At Weng'an , both the carbon cycle anomaly and the sediments typical of the uppermost Doushantuo Formation at the Yangtze Gorges are missing , implying a substantial hiatus . Comparison of broadly equivalent strata in southern Australia and the western United States suggests a stratigraphic architecture similar to that in southern China , where similar carbon cycle anomalies are truncated by unconformities ( 15 ) . In the western United States , the post-anomaly unconformity removes a minimum of 130 m of section , more than the entire thickness of the Doushantuo Formation . These observations suggest that the unconformity separating the Ediacaran faunas and the carbon cycle anomaly in southern China may , in fact , hide a lot of time , thereby decoupling the environmental and biological events that the authors wish to connect . This is not meant to detract from the important radiometric calibration that Condon et al . provide , but rather to note that the stratigraphic relations between these dates , and therefore their connection to evolutionary events , are far from straightforward . According to Condon et al. , the rapid diversification of complex multicellular organisms in Ediacaran oceans forced the carbon cycle anomaly seen worldwide , but this seems possible only if there is no real time missing across the upper Doushantuo unconformity . If this is not the case , then this interpretation may be placing the cart before the horse . Alternative models suggest that environmental changes may have driven evolutionary transformations . In particular , atmospheric oxygen -- long believed to be an external forcing factor to evolution -- appears to have built up rapidly during the Ediacaran Period , not because of a discrete biological event but as a result of the tectonic forces that lift and erode mountain ranges ( 16 ) . Through precise radiometric clocks and clever stratigraphic connections , geoscientists can increasingly correlate Ediacaran sediments that are separated widely in space and time . These tools allow us to piece together a complex puzzle of unforgettable biological events against a background of repetitive climatic and environmental perturbations . However , even with exact dates , the cyclicity of these events and the specter of a fragmentary rock record add uncertainty to our picture of Ediacaran Earth history . References 1 . A. H.

9928,"""GEOLOGY : The Calibration of Ediacaran Time Alan J. Kaufman * More than a century ago , the last great geological period was formally ratified by an international committee . This was the final rocky step in the subdivision of deep time based on the evolutionary progression of animal fossils . However , recent years have seen the identification of an older and tumultuous new interval , the Ediacaran Period , during which Earth 's earliest soft-bodied organisms emerged in the oceans . This interval was recently ratified ( 1 ) , underscoring advances in the absolute dating ( 2-6 ) and worldwide correlation of geological strata that were deposited in isolated basins before true animals exploded onto the scene in the succeeding Cambrian Period . On page 95 of this issue , Condon et al . ( 7 ) present precise age constraints for the Ediacaran Period . The authors have analyzed volcanic dust in two key depositional layers in the Doushantuo Formation of southern China . Their radiometric dates provide important insights into the rates of geological and evolutionary processes . The first layer , with an age of about 635 million years , is at the base of the new interval , whereas the second , at about 550 million years , may constrain the age of an environmental disaster ( 8-10 ) that is closely associated with the rapid diversification of the Ediacara biota ( see the figure ) that lend their name to the new Period . http : //www.sciencemag.org/content/vo ... m/59-1-med.gif Figure 1 Early animals ? A pile of three-dimensionally preserved casts of the soft-bodied Ediacaran organism Ernietta from ~545 million-year-old sediments in the Nama Group of southern Namibia . The scale bar corresponds to 15 cm . Convention previously focused on the evolutionary first appearance of a specific fossil or assemblage to define the beginning of new geological periods . In contrast , the beginning of the Ediacaran period is defined by the base of a marine carbonate rock , which formed in southern Australia in the aftermath of a distinctive and potentially global ice age ( 11 , 12 ) . Equivalent glacial rocks occur immediately beneath similar carbonates at the base of the Doushantuo Formation . In the area studied by Condon et al. , the new ages constrain the Doushantuo Formation , which represents most of the Ediacaran Period , to some 85 million years -- a remarkably long interval for only about 100 m of rock . This observation begs the question : How much time may be missing in Ediacaran strata from southern China ? In the absence of dates between the two radiometric tie points , one must consider two possibilities : Either the sediments accumulated continuously , albeit slowly ( some two orders of magnitude more slowly than in similar environments of the same age ) , or there are breaks in time ( hiatuses or unconformities ) hidden within the poorly exposed layers . On the basis of limited physical data , Condon et al . suggest the presence of two such unconformities in their study area near the Yangtze Gorges . The duration of these stratigraphic breaks with respect to the environmental anomaly -- reflecting a dramatic change in the cycling of carbon on Earth 's surface -- and subsequent biological innovations form the cornerstone of their conclusions , and deserve closer examination . Spectacular fossil animal embryos ( 13 , 14 ) of great evolutionary importance are found at Weng'an ( some 375 km to the southwest of the authors ' study area ) , where the Doushantuo Formation accumulated closer to the shoreline and records only a single surface of unconformity . In such nearshore environments , oceanic sediments are often exposed above sea level , resulting in the removal of underlying sediments and hence the erasure of some fraction of geological time . Which of the two hiatal surfaces from the deeper-water sections at the Yangtze Gorges correlates to the single unconformity at Weng'an ? The data are more equivocal than presented by Condon et al. , and the choice carries important evolutionary consequences . At the Yangtze Gorges , the extraordinary carbon cycle anomaly recorded in marine carbonates near the top of the Doushanto Formation is truncated by the uppermost unconformity . Condon et al . suggest that there is little time missing across the surface , thereby preserving a causal relation between the environmental perturbation and the rapid diversification of Ediacara organisms and associated faunas around 550 million years ago . However , correlation of this surface and the intervening sediments back to Weng'an tells another story . At Weng'an , both the carbon cycle anomaly and the sediments typical of the uppermost Doushantuo Formation at the Yangtze Gorges are missing , implying a substantial hiatus . Comparison of broadly equivalent strata in southern Australia and the western United States suggests a stratigraphic architecture similar to that in southern China , where similar carbon cycle anomalies are truncated by unconformities ( 15 ) . In the western United States , the post-anomaly unconformity removes a minimum of 130 m of section , more than the entire thickness of the Doushantuo Formation . These observations suggest that the unconformity separating the Ediacaran faunas and the carbon cycle anomaly in southern China may , in fact , hide a lot of time , thereby decoupling the environmental and biological events that the authors wish to connect . This is not meant to detract from the important radiometric calibration that Condon et al . provide , but rather to note that the stratigraphic relations between these dates , and therefore their connection to evolutionary events , are far from straightforward . According to Condon et al. , the rapid diversification of complex multicellular organisms in Ediacaran oceans forced the carbon cycle anomaly seen worldwide , but this seems possible only if there is no real time missing across the upper Doushantuo unconformity . If this is not the case , then this interpretation may be placing the cart before the horse . Alternative models suggest that environmental changes may have driven evolutionary transformations . In particular , atmospheric oxygen -- long believed to be an external forcing factor to evolution -- appears to have built up rapidly during the Ediacaran Period , not because of a discrete biological event but as a result of the tectonic forces that lift and erode mountain ranges ( 16 ) . Through precise radiometric clocks and clever stratigraphic connections , geoscientists can increasingly correlate Ediacaran sediments that are separated widely in space and time . These tools allow us to piece together a complex puzzle of unforgettable biological events against a background of repetitive climatic and environmental perturbations . However , even with exact dates , the cyclicity of these events and the specter of a fragmentary rock record add uncertainty to our picture of Ediacaran Earth history . References 1 . A. H.

9928,"""GEOLOGY : The Calibration of Ediacaran Time Alan J. Kaufman * More than a century ago , the last great geological period was formally ratified by an international committee . This was the final rocky step in the subdivision of deep time based on the evolutionary progression of animal fossils . However , recent years have seen the identification of an older and tumultuous new interval , the Ediacaran Period , during which Earth 's earliest soft-bodied organisms emerged in the oceans . This interval was recently ratified ( 1 ) , underscoring advances in the absolute dating ( 2-6 ) and worldwide correlation of geological strata that were deposited in isolated basins before true animals exploded onto the scene in the succeeding Cambrian Period . On page 95 of this issue , Condon et al . ( 7 ) present precise age constraints for the Ediacaran Period . The authors have analyzed volcanic dust in two key depositional layers in the Doushantuo Formation of southern China . Their radiometric dates provide important insights into the rates of geological and evolutionary processes . The first layer , with an age of about 635 million years , is at the base of the new interval , whereas the second , at about 550 million years , may constrain the age of an environmental disaster ( 8-10 ) that is closely associated with the rapid diversification of the Ediacara biota ( see the figure ) that lend their name to the new Period . http : //www.sciencemag.org/content/vo ... m/59-1-med.gif Figure 1 Early animals ? A pile of three-dimensionally preserved casts of the soft-bodied Ediacaran organism Ernietta from ~545 million-year-old sediments in the Nama Group of southern Namibia . The scale bar corresponds to 15 cm . Convention previously focused on the evolutionary first appearance of a specific fossil or assemblage to define the beginning of new geological periods . In contrast , the beginning of the Ediacaran period is defined by the base of a marine carbonate rock , which formed in southern Australia in the aftermath of a distinctive and potentially global ice age ( 11 , 12 ) . Equivalent glacial rocks occur immediately beneath similar carbonates at the base of the Doushantuo Formation . In the area studied by Condon et al. , the new ages constrain the Doushantuo Formation , which represents most of the Ediacaran Period , to some 85 million years -- a remarkably long interval for only about 100 m of rock . This observation begs the question : How much time may be missing in Ediacaran strata from southern China ? In the absence of dates between the two radiometric tie points , one must consider two possibilities : Either the sediments accumulated continuously , albeit slowly ( some two orders of magnitude more slowly than in similar environments of the same age ) , or there are breaks in time ( hiatuses or unconformities ) hidden within the poorly exposed layers . On the basis of limited physical data , Condon et al . suggest the presence of two such unconformities in their study area near the Yangtze Gorges . The duration of these stratigraphic breaks with respect to the environmental anomaly -- reflecting a dramatic change in the cycling of carbon on Earth 's surface -- and subsequent biological innovations form the cornerstone of their conclusions , and deserve closer examination . Spectacular fossil animal embryos ( 13 , 14 ) of great evolutionary importance are found at Weng'an ( some 375 km to the southwest of the authors ' study area ) , where the Doushantuo Formation accumulated closer to the shoreline and records only a single surface of unconformity . In such nearshore environments , oceanic sediments are often exposed above sea level , resulting in the removal of underlying sediments and hence the erasure of some fraction of geological time . Which of the two hiatal surfaces from the deeper-water sections at the Yangtze Gorges correlates to the single unconformity at Weng'an ? The data are more equivocal than presented by Condon et al. , and the choice carries important evolutionary consequences . At the Yangtze Gorges , the extraordinary carbon cycle anomaly recorded in marine carbonates near the top of the Doushanto Formation is truncated by the uppermost unconformity . Condon et al . suggest that there is little time missing across the surface , thereby preserving a causal relation between the environmental perturbation and the rapid diversification of Ediacara organisms and associated faunas around 550 million years ago .
