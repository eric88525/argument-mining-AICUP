218,"""No disagreements . Something left out ( probably because it was assumed ) , is memory .

1287,"""4 . By RUTH FADEN , ANNE DRAPKIN LYERLY and MAGGIE LITTLE WHEN diseases like swine flu hit , pregnant women are especially at risk . And yet we know surprisingly little about how to treat them . In its guidelines for the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that pregnant women infected or at high risk for infection should take the recommended adult dosage : Â “ Pregnancy should not be considered a contraindicationÂ ” to taking the drugs , because the benefits of treatment Â “ likely outweigh the theoretical risks of antiviral use.Â ” But we donÂ ’ t know whether this is true . Concerns about the ethics of performing drug studies on pregnant women mean we know far less about how to treat them . It is perfectly possible that the standard adult dose of antivirals will not work in the pregnant body . Pregnancy acts as a wild card when it comes to medication . Changes in blood flow , digestion , kidney function and enzymatic activity alter the ways that drugs act on the body . There is almost no data on how antivirals function during pregnancy , and the same is true for many other drugs on the market . The consequences are potentially profound . One of the antibiotics used for treating exposure to anthrax is metabolized so quickly by the pregnant body that no dose , no matter how large , is likely to be effective . If the threat of widespread anthrax attacks after 9/11 had been realized , pregnant women and their babies would have faced disastrous consequences . We should not make the same mistake in planning for the possible reemergence of swine flu in the fall . One pregnant woman in America has already died from the flu . Although other health problems complicated her illness , her death is a reminder that we need to understand how to medicate mothers-to-be . Research should be done now , while pregnant women are already taking antivirals . Studying blood samples from as few as two dozen women would get us a long way toward determining whether the standard dose is effective .""","""WouldnÂ ’ t it be wonderful if , in this male-centered world , drugs were designed to be women-friendly , especially pregnant women-friendly ?""",AGREE,"""Concerns about the ethics of performing drug studies on pregnant women mean we know far less about how to treat them""","""WouldnÂ ’ t it be wonderful if , in this male-centered world , drugs were designed to be women-friendly ,"""

It should be noted though that analysis only included a subset of the possible optimality feature of the code . From article 3 The analysis above did not include other nearly optimal features of the genetic code including : A ) The actual code is far better than other possible codes in minimizing the number of amino acids incorporated until translation is interrupted after a frameshift error occurred . B ) The code is highly optimal for encoding arbitrary additional information , i.e. , information other than the amino acid sequence in protein-coding sequences . Thus , two more features for which the code is close to being optimal . What is interesting about these two optimal features is that they may facilitate evolution i.e . the code is primed for the future by being optimal in allowing future incorporation of additional information . In article nr.4 The coevolution theory of the origin of the genetic code is discussed .

Good citizens vs criminals with the criminals 'winning ' is usually not the way it goes . Good citizens are the ones who catch and throw the criminals in jail . They are our police officers , the anonymous tipsters , and the countless law abiding citizens in our country . The way your talking you act like the only way for the good citizens to win is to have a gun or be ready to use force . If you want to do one better you could eliminate guns completely in order to lower the risk of deaths in gun fights . You ca n't debate the fact that less guns equals less murders . You can debate that without guns there would be more deaths to other weapons although you ca n't debate it would be to the same extent as gun murders and crimes would be .

Although I am not a gun rights advocate , I am also not anti-gun and in the spirit of trying to get the two sides of this issue to reach some sort of understanding , here is what I believe to be the major points of those who support a ban on assult weapons . First of all , I do agree that the definition of assult weapons is a little strange , and it essentially boils down to the guns that look scary . However , the spirit of the law was to try to ban weapons whose main purpose was militaristic in nature . That is , guns that are able to be fired rapidly , have a large magazine , and reasonable stopping power . Thus , although the ban would not eliminate all of the `` dangerous `` weapons ( I assume that an M1 , the rifle that beat the Nazis , would be legal ) it does cover a lot of them . Of course , most 2nd amendment rights supporters would say that all this does n't matter , it does n't matter what purpose the gun serves , it is unconstitutional to infringe upon the rights of Americans to own any gun they want , no matter the purpose . What gun control advocates would say , however , is that the constitution says 'arms ' not guns , and it becomes the job of the goverment to determine what was meant my this . I think that most gun control advocates would agree that the second amendment probably did not intend for people to be able to buy chemical or biological weapons , for example . And , I for one , hope that is not what they meant , particularly in light of the recent war on terrorism . A common remark is `` why would it matter if I had a nuclear weapon if I am a law abiding citizen and would never use it against my neighbor ? `` The problem is that we do n't know what the intention of everyone is , and there are certainly terrorists in this country now who are American citizens and would use such powerful weapons against usif they were able to acquire them . Of course a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon , but the point is that ( I think ) most people do n't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want , so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own .

2784,"""Thanks Patriot for the well researched response . Although I am not a gun rights advocate , I am also not anti-gun and in the spirit of trying to get the two sides of this issue to reach some sort of understanding , here is what I believe to be the major points of those who support a ban on assult weapons . First of all , I do agree that the definition of assult weapons is a little strange , and it essentially boils down to the guns that look scary . However , the spirit of the law was to try to ban weapons whose main purpose was militaristic in nature . That is , guns that are able to be fired rapidly , have a large magazine , and reasonable stopping power . Thus , although the ban would not eliminate all of the `` dangerous `` weapons ( I assume that an M1 , the rifle that beat the Nazis , would be legal ) it does cover a lot of them . Of course , most 2nd amendment rights supporters would say that all this does n't matter , it does n't matter what purpose the gun serves , it is unconstitutional to infringe upon the rights of Americans to own any gun they want , no matter the purpose . What gun control advocates would say , however , is that the constitution says 'arms ' not guns , and it becomes the job of the goverment to determine what was meant my this . I think that most gun control advocates would agree that the second amendment probably did not intend for people to be able to buy chemical or biological weapons , for example . And , I for one , hope that is not what they meant , particularly in light of the recent war on terrorism . A common remark is `` why would it matter if I had a nuclear weapon if I am a law abiding citizen and would never use it against my neighbor ? `` The problem is that we do n't know what the intention of everyone is , and there are certainly terrorists in this country now who are American citizens and would use such powerful weapons against usif they were able to acquire them . Of course a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon , but the point is that ( I think ) most people do n't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want , so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own . I do n't think that I covered all of your points , Patriot , but this is getting long , so I will cut this off here , and I hope to get a response from you . I will be interested in your thoughts . -Dan""","""The ban on assault weapons stands on such poltically weak and Constitutionally weak ground that Congress only had the guts and the will to try it for 10 years .

So it happens that my period does n't come . I find out that during this most unpleasurable experience he decided to take the condom off . I knew I was pregnant . And I knew that my mom would kill me if she found out so I kept it to myself . After a few weeks my mom started to get bad feelings and confronted me , had me take a pregnancy test , and as I said was ready to kill me . She was ashamed and really did n't give me much of an option as to whether or not I wanted to keep the baby . I also knew deep down that I was not ready to have a baby nor did I have the financial means to take care of one ( unless I wanted to live off of welfare ) . The father was not going to play an active role in this baby 's life , as far as he was concerned this was all a big joke to him . So I went to the clinic ( passed through all the pro-life activists ) and had the procedure done . I was scared but you know , I knew it was the right thing to do . I 'm 27 now and still think back and ask myself if I have any regrets . I would have a child that would be around 11 years old . I wonder what kind if life the 2 of us would be living .

And here 's a scholarly article from the biblical perspective that points out the different interpretations Theologians consider , both conservative and liberal . http : //www.grisda.org/origins/22058.htm BIBLICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE GENESIS FLOOD Richard M. Davidson John Nevin Andrews Professor of Old Testament Interpretation Old Testament Department Andrews University , Berrien Springs , Michigan Origins 22 ( 2 ) :58-73 ( 1995 ) . WHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT The extent of the Genesis Flood has been vigorously debated by biblical scholars . For those who accept a recent creation week of six literal consecutive , twenty-four-days , a universal Flood is necessary to explain the existence of the geologic column . The thesis of this study is that only the traditional interpretation which posits a literal , universal , world-wide Genesis Flood does full justice to all the relevant biblical data . The author summarizes twenty-two lines of biblical evidence Â— including terminological , thematic , contextual , grammatical-syntactical , literary-structural , logical-conceptual , theological , canonical , and typological which support the universality of the Genesis Flood .

Our apologies for any inconvenience this might cause . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I . Conflicting Schools of Interpretation One of the most controversial aspects of the Flood narrative concerns the extent of the Genesis Flood . Three major positions are taken : ( 1 ) the traditional , which asserts the universal , world-wide , nature of the Deluge ; ( 2 ) limited or local flood theories , which narrow the scope of the Flood story to a particular geographical location in Mesopotamia ; and ( 3 ) non-literal ( symbolic ) interpretation , which suggests that the Flood story is a non-historical account written to teach theological truth . Against this third position , the non-historical , we must note the evidences within the biblical account affirming the historical nature of the Flood . In the literary structure of the Flood story ( see Shea 1979 ) , the genealogical frame or envelope construction ( Genesis 5:32 and 9:28-29 ) plus the secondary genealogies ( Genesis 6:9-10 and 9:18-19 ) are indicators that the account is intended to be factual history . The use of the genealogical term tÃ´ledÃ´t ( `` generations , `` `` account `` ) in the Flood story ( 6:9 ) as throughout Genesis ( 13 times , structuring the whole book ) , indicates that the author intended this story to be as historically veracious as the rest of Genesis ( Doukhan 1978 , p 167-220 ) . Walter Kaiser analyzes the literary form of Genesis 1-11 and concludes that this whole section of Genesis must be taken as `` historical narrative prose `` ( Kaiser 1970 ) . A number of references in the book of Job may allude to the then-relatively-recent Flood ( Job 9:5-8 ; 12:14-15 ; 14:11-12 ; 22:15-17 ; 26:10-14 ; 28:9 ; 38:8-11 ; see Morris 1988 , p 26-30 ) . The historical occurrence of the Flood is part of the saving/judging acts of God , and its historicity is assumed and essential to the theological arguments of later biblical writers employing Flood typology ( see Davidson 1981 , p 326-327 ) ; more on this point later . Thus according to the biblical writers , far from being a non-historical , symbolical , or mythical account written only to teach theological truths , the Flood narrative is intended to accurately record a real , literal , historical event . For evangelical Christians who take seriously the biblical record and accept the historicity of the Flood account , the question still remains whether the event described is to be taken as a local , limited flood or a universal , world-wide cataclysm . The limited flood theories rest primarily on scientific arguments that present seemingly difficult geological , biological , and anthropological problems for a universal flood . ( See Boardman 1990 , p 212-223 ; Custance 1979 , p 28-58 ; Kidner 1967 , p 93-95 ; Mitchell 1982/1993 ; Ramm 1954 , p 232-249 ; Young 1977 , p 171-210 ) . Since the scientific argumentation is not the subject of this article , I can only suggest that these problems are not insurmountable , although much more study is needed . A number of studies provides a growing body of evidence for diluvial catastrophism as an alternative to conventional long-age geology ( see Coffin and Brown 1983 ; Roth 1985 , 1986a , 1988 ; Whitcomb 1988 ; Baumgardner 1994a , b ) . The local flood theories further assert that the terminology describing the extent of the Flood should be interpreted in a relative and not absolute universal sense . The various seemingly universal terms are regarded as implying only a limited locality ; they are seen to indicate universality within the writer 's world-view but a limited scope in terms of our modern world view . ( See Boardman 1990 , p 223-226 ; Custance 1979 , p 15-27 ; Kidner 1967 , p 93-95 ; Ramm 1954 , p 241-242 . ) We will take up this issue in the next section of this article . The traditional conservative understanding of the Flood narrative is that Genesis 6-9 describes a universal , world-wide Deluge . It should be noted that this is also the view of the majority of liberal-critical commentators on Genesis 6-9 , although they regard the biblical view as borrowed from the ANE accounts and not historical . ( See Hasel 1975 , p 78 and Note 16 for bibliography of representatives of this position : Fohrer , Koehler , Noth , Procksch , Skinner , Sarna , Speiser , von Rad , Vriezen , Zimmerli , etc . Some of these and other more recent representatives of this view are cited later in this article . ) The thesis of this article is that only the traditional position of a literal , universal world-wide Flood does full justice to the biblical data , and this universal interpretation is crucial for Flood theology in Genesis and for the theological implications drawn by later biblical writers . II . Biblical Terminology in Genesis 6-9 Indicating Universality Perhaps the most important kind of biblical evidence for a universal Flood is the specific all-inclusive terminology found within the Genesis account itself . The late Gerhard Hasel has provided a careful treatment of this terminology in three penetrating studies in previous issues of Origins ( Hasel 1974 , 1975 , 1978 ) , and therefore I need not go into detail in this article . Eight different terms or phrases in Genesis 6-9 , most echoing their counterparts in the world-wide creation account of Genesis 1-2 , indicate universality . First , the term haÃ‰ares `` the earth , `` occurring 46 times in the Flood narrative ( Genesis 6:12 , 13 , 17 , etc . ) , always without any accompanying genitive of limitation , clearly parallels the usage of the same term in the account of world-wide , universal creation in Genesis 1:1 , 2 , 10 . ( While the term at times elsewhere may be used without a genitive and still in context be limited in scope to a certain `` land , `` the explicit link to creation in the Flood account ( see especially Genesis 6:6 , 7 ) clearly gives a universal context for its usage in Genesis 6-9 . ) Some have argued that if Moses had wished to indicate the entire world , he would have used the Hebrew term tebel , which means the world as a whole , or dry land in the sense of continents . This word is never used in the Flood narrative . But it should be pointed out that tebel is never used in the entire Pentateuch , including the creation account . In fact , the term appears no where in the narrative portions of the Hebrew Bible , but only in poetic texts ( 39 times ) usually as a poetic synonym in parallel with haÃ‰ares `` the earth. `` Thus this argument from silence does not adequately consider the contextual and poetic use of terminology , and carries little weight . A second expression , `` upon the face of all the earth `` ÃŒal-penÃª kol-haÃ‰ares ( Genesis 7:3 ; 8:9 ) , clearly alludes to the first occurrence of the same phrase in the universal context of creation ( Genesis 1:29 ; cf . Genesis 1:2 for a related universal expression ) , and thus here also implies a universality of the same dimension , i.e. , the entire surface of the global mass . While the shortened term `` all the earth `` ( kol-haÃ‰ares ) by itself may have a limited meaning elsewhere when indicated by the immediate context ( see Exodus 10:5 , 15 ; Numbers 22:5 , 11 ; 1 Kings 4:34 ; 10:24 ; 2 Chronicles 36:23 ; Genesis 41:57 ) , the immediate context of the Flood story is the universal sinfulness of humankind whom God had made and created ( Genesis 6:6,7 ) to have dominion over `` all the earth `` ( Genesis 1:26 ) , and the succeeding context is the universal dispersal of man after the Tower of Babel `` upon the face of all the earth `` ( Genesis 11:4 , 8 , 9 ) . In each of the four occurrences of the phrase `` upon the face of all the earth `` in Genesis outside the Flood story ( Genesis 1:29 ; 11:4 , 8 , 9 ) , it clearly has the universal sense of the entire land surface of the globe , and there is nothing in the Flood narrative to indicate any less universality . ( It should be also noted that the one place in Genesis where in context a similar phrase `` upon all the face of the earth `` is not universal [ the famine mentioned in Genesis 41:56 ] , the Hebrew has a change in word order from elsewhere in Genesis [ ÃŒal-kol penÃª haÃ‰ares ] ) . Third , the phrase `` face of the ground `` penÃª haÃ‰adamah ( five times in the Flood narrative , 7:4 , 22 , 23 ; 8:8 , 13 ) , occurs in parallel with universal terms we have just noted , `` the earth `` ( 7:23 ) and `` face of all the earth `` ( 8:9 ) ; and this phrase `` face of the ground `` likewise harks back to its first usage in the universal context of creation ( Genesis 2:6 ) . Fourth , the term kol-basar `` all flesh `` occurs 12 times in Genesis 6-9 ( Genesis 6:12 , 13 , 17 , 19 ; 7:16 , 21 ; 8:17 ; 9:11 , 15 , 16 , 17 ) . The word kol `` all `` ( which can occasionally express less than totality if the context demands ) , before an indeterminate noun with no article or possessive suffix , as here in Genesis 6-9 , indicates totality . God 's announcement to destroy `` all flesh `` ( Genesis 6:13 , 17 ) and the narrator 's comment that `` all flesh `` died ( Genesis 7:21-22 ) , except the inhabitants of the ark , indicates universal destruction . The one occurrence of kol plus the determinate noun ha basar `` all the flesh `` ( in Genesis 7:15 ) likewise indicates totality as well as unity . Fifth , the expression `` every living thing `` ( kol-hahay ) of all flesh ( Genesis 6:19 ) , is another expression of totality ; in 7:4 , 23 , the similar term kol-hayeqÃ » m means literally , `` all existence. `` This term is given further universal dimensions by the addition of the clause harking back to creation Â— `` all existence that I have made `` ( 7:4 ) Â— and by the exclusive statement `` Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive `` ( 7:23 ) . As Hasel puts it : There is hardly any stronger way in Hebrew to emphasize total destruction of 'all existence ' of human and animal life on earth than the way it has been expressed . The writer of the Genesis Flood story employed terminology , formulae , and syntactical structures of the type that could not be more emphatic and explicit in expressing his concept of a universal , world-wide flood ( Hasel 1975 , p 86 ) . Sixth , the phrase `` under the whole heaven `` ( tahat kol-haÂšÂšamayim , Genesis 7:19 ) , is used six times in the OT outside of the Flood narrative , and always with a universal meaning ( see Deuteronomy 2:25 ; 4:19 ; Job 28:24 ; 37:3 ; 41:11 ; Daniel 9:12 ) . For example , the phrase is used to describe God 's omniscience : `` For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees under the whole heavens `` ( Job 28:24 ) . Again , it depicts God 's sovereignty : `` Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine `` ( Job 41:11 KJV ) . ( Note that the usage in Deuteronomy 2:25 , describing `` the nations under the whole heaven , `` is further qualified and limited by the phrase `` who shall hear the report of you , `` and thus is potentially universal and not an exception to the universal sense . ) The universal phrase `` under the whole heaven `` or `` under all the heavens `` also universalizes the phrase `` under heaven `` ( Genesis 6:17 ) in this same Flood context . The word `` heaven `` alone can have a local meaning [ e.g. , 1 Kings 18:45 ] , but here the context is clearly universal . Ecclesiastes , which contains numerous allusions to creation , likewise utilizes the term `` under heaven `` with a universal intention ( Ecclesiastes 1:13 ; 2:3 ; 3:1 ; cf . the parallel universal expression `` under the sun `` in Ecclesiastes 1:3 , 9 ; 2:11 , 17 ; etc. ) . In the Flood account this phrase `` under the whole heaven `` is part of two forceful verses describing the extent of the Flood : `` and the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered . The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward , and the mountains were covered `` ( 7:19 , 20 ) . Critical scholar John Skinner notes that 7:19 , 20 `` not only asserts its [ the flood 's ] universality , but so to speak proves it , by giving the exact height of the waters above the highest mountains `` ( Skinner 1930/1956 , p 165 ) . The biblical language here simply can not be explained in terms of a local sky , and certainly can not refer to the local mountains being covered by snow , as some proponents of a local flood suggest . H.C. Leupold points out that the writer of vs. 19 is not content with a single use of kol ( `` all `` ) in `` all the high mountains , `` but `` since 'all ' is known to be used in a relative sense , the writer removes all possible ambiguity by adding the phrase 'under all the heavens . ' A double 'all ' ( kol ) can not allow for so relative a sense . It almost constitutes a Hebrew superlative . So we believe that the text disposes of the question of the universality of the Flood `` ( Leupold 1942 , p 301-302 ) . Seventh , Hasel devoted an entire scholarly article to the phrase `` all the fountains [ maÃŒyenoth ] of the Great Deep [ tehÃ´m rabbah ] `` ( Genesis 7:11 ; 8:2 ) , and showed how it is linked with the universal `` Deep `` ( tehÃ´m ) or world-ocean in Genesis 1:2 ( cf . Psalm 104:6 : `` Thou didst cover it [ the earth ] with deep [ tehÃ´m ] as with a garment ; the waters were standing above the mountains `` ) . The `` breaking up `` and `` bursting forth `` ( i.e. , geological faulting ) of not just one subterranean water spring in Mesopotamia , but of all the `` fountains `` of the Great Deep , coupled in the same verse with the opening of the windows of the heavens , far transcends a local scene . Hasel perceptively concludes that `` the bursting forth of the waters from the fountains of the 'great deep ' refers to the splitting open of springs of subterranean waters with such might and force that together with the torrential downpouring of waters stored in the atmospheric heavens a worldwide flood comes about `` ( Hasel 1974 , p 71 ) . Eighth , in another article , Hasel ( 1978 ) shows how the Hebrew Bible reserved a special term mabbÃ » l which in its 13 occurrences refers exclusively to the universal Genesis Flood ( 12 occurrences in Genesis , once in Psalm 29 : 10 ) . This word may be derived from the Hebrew root ybl `` to flow , to stream. `` The term mabbÃ » l , which in the Flood narrative is usually associated with mayim `` waters , `` seems to have become `` a technical term for waters flowing or streaming forth and as such designates the flood ( deluge ) being caused by waters . ... mabbÃ » l is in the Old Testament a term consistently employed for the flood ( deluge ) which was caused by torrential rains and the bursting forth of subterranean waters `` ( Hasel 1978 , p 92-93 ) . This technical term clearly sets the Genesis Deluge apart from all local floods , and is utilized in the Psalm 29:10 to illustrate Yahweh 's universal sovereignty over the world at the time of the Noahic Flood : `` The Lord sat enthroned at the Flood , and the Lord sits as King forever. `` Summarizing regarding the technical terminology used for the extent of the Flood in Genesis 6-9 , Hasel writes : The Genesis flood narrative provides ample evidence of being an account which is to be understood as a historical narrative in prose style . It expects to be taken literally . There is a consistent and overwhelming amount of terminology and formulae ... which on the basis of context and syntax has uniformly indicated that the flood story wants to be understood in a universal sense : the waters destroyed all human and animal plus bird life on the entire land mass of the globe . To read it otherwise means to force a meaning on the carefully written and specific syntactical constructions of the original language which the text itself rejects ( Hasel 1975 , p 87 ) . III . Other Biblical Evidence for a Universal Flood Many additional lines of biblical evidence converge in affirming the universal extent of the Flood and also reveal the theological significance of this conclusion . We will summarize fourteen points that emerge from the biblical text . First , the trajectory of major themes in Genesis 1-11 Â— Creation , Fall , plan of redemption , spread of sin Â— is universal in scope and calls for a corresponding universal judgment . We have already noted in reference to specific Flood terminology the numerous allusions to the universal context of creation . The creation of `` the heavens and the earth `` certainly is not local in scope according to Genesis 1-2 . Likewise , the Fall of humanity in Adam and Eve led to the sinful condition of the entire human race ( haÃ‰dam ) , not just the inhabitants of Mesopotamia ( see Genesis 6:5 , 11 ; Romans 3:19 ; 5:12 ) . Again , the Protoevangelium ( first Gospel promise ) outlined in Genesis 3:15 , involves the universal moral struggle between the spiritual descendants ( or `` seed `` ) of the serpent and the spiritual descendants ( `` seed `` ) of the woman , culminating in the victory of the representative Messianic Seed over the serpent ( see Robertson 1980 ) . This plan of redemption is certainly universal in scope . In a similar way , the sinful condition of humankind described at the time of the Flood includes more than those living in the Fertile Crescent . From God 's perspective , not simply from the culturally conditioned local view of the narrator , we have the results of the divine investigative judgment : `` And God saw that the wickedness of man ( haÃ‰dam , humankind ) was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually `` ( Genesis 6:5 ) . Such universal sinfulness naturally calls for universal judgment . Second , the divine purpose given for the bringing of the Flood makes explicit its universal scope : `` And the Lord said , ' I will destroy man [ ( haÃ‰dam ) , humanity ] whom I have created from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , creeping things and birds of the air , for I am sorry that I have made them `` ( Genesis 6:7 ) . Nothing less than a complete destruction of the human race ( except for Noah , 6:8 ) seems envisaged . Given the length of time from creation ( over 1650 years minimum ) , the longevity of the antediluvians ( nearly a thousand years ) , and God 's command at creation to `` fill the earth `` ( Genesis 1:28 ) , it is highly unlikely that the pre-Flood population would have stayed only in Mesopotamia . Thus the destruction of humanity would necessitate more than a local Flood . Third , the genealogical lines from both Adam ( Genesis 4:17-26 ; 5:1-31 ) and Noah ( Genesis 10:1-32 ; 11:1-9 ) are exclusive in nature , indicating that as Adam was father of all pre-Flood humanity , so Noah was father of all post-Flood humanity . From the descendants of Noah `` the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood `` ( Genesis 10 : 32 ) , and the Tower of Babel experience spreads humanity across the globe ( Genesis 11:1-19 ) . Striking extra-biblical evidence that all human races , and not just the nations of the Fertile Crescent , are included in the descendants of Noah , and retain memory of the universal Flood , is found in the amazing prevalence of ancient flood stories throughout the world . Over 230 different flood stories are known and occur among the most diverse peoples of the earth ( see Frazer 1918 , 1:105-361 ; Nelson 1931 ) . A world-wide flood is by far the most frequently-given cause for past universally destructive calamities in the folk literature of antiquity ( Thompson 1955 , 1:182-194 ) . A remarkable number of these oral and written traditions agree upon the basic points of the biblical account : all humankind was destroyed by a great flood as a result of divine judgment against human sin , and a single man and his family or a few friends survived the deluge in a ship or other sea-faring vessel . The stories nearest to the area of the Dispersion at Babel are the closest in detail to the biblical account ( see Heidel 1946 , Jacobsen 1981 , and Lambert and Millard 1969 ) . This vast body of ancient witnesses to a world-wide Deluge is powerful testimony to the historicity and universality of the biblical Flood . Fourth , the same inclusive divine blessing to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth is given to both Adam and Noah ( Genesis 1:28 ; 9:1 ) . This is another linkage between universal creation and the flood , between the original beginning and the `` new beginning. `` As the human race at creation flows from Adam and Eve , so the postdiluvial humanity is populated through Noah . Fifth , the covenant ( Genesis 9:9-10 ) with its rainbow sign ( Genesis 9:12-17 ) is clearly linked to the extent of the Flood , and includes the whole earth ( Genesis 9:13-17 ) . If there was only a local flood , then the covenant would be only a limited covenant , and the rainbow sign of `` the all-embracing universality of the Divine mercy `` ( Delitzsch 1888/1976 , 1:289-290 ) would be stripped of its meaning . Sixth , the viability of God 's promise ( Genesis 9:15 ; cf . Isaiah 54:9 ) and the integrity of God in keeping His promise is wrapped up in the world-wide extent of the Flood . This point can not be underscored too heavily : if Genesis 6-9 describes only a local flood , then God has broken His promise every time another local flood has happened ! The only way God 's promise not to send another flood to destroy every living thing ( Genesis 8:21 ) can be seen to have been kept is if the Flood was a universal one and the whole human race outside the ark was destroyed . Seventh , the universality of the Flood is underscored by the enormous size of the ark detailed in Genesis 6:14-15 and the stated necessity for saving all the kinds of animals and plants in the ark ( Genesis 6:16-21 ; 7:2-3 ) . A massive ark filled with representatives of all non-aquatic animal/plant kinds would be unnecessary if this were only a local flood , for these kinds could have been preserved elsewhere in the world . Yet the divine insistence in the biblical record is that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve representatives of all of the various kinds ( Genesis 6:19-20 ) . As a matter of fact , if only a local flood were in view , the building of any ark at all , even for Noah and his family , would have been superfluous Â— God could simply have warned Noah and his family in time to escape from the coming judgment , just as he did with Lot in Sodom . But the point of the narrative concerning the ark is that there was no other escape ; in the midst of the Flood `` only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained `` ( Genesis 7:23 ) . Eighth , the covering of `` all the high mountains `` by at least 15 cubits ( Genesis 7:19-20 ) could not involve simply a local flood , since water seeks its own level across the surface of the globe . Even one high mountain covered in a local Mesopotamian setting would require that same height of water everywhere on the planet 's surface . In this connection we note that it is not necessary to postulate the existence of mountains as high as Mt . Everest at the time of the Flood , and thus to require waters covering the earth to a depth of six miles , as some proponents of a local flood suggest would be necessary ( see Ramm 1954 , p 242 ) . The antediluvian mountains were very possibly much lower than at present . Passages in the book of Job and Psalms may well be referring to the process of postdiluvian mountain uplift ( see Job 9:5 ; 28:9 ; and Psalm 104:7-8 ) . Also in this connection we may address the objection that proponents of a local flood often raise , namely , that a world-wide Flood would imply `` that the earth 's surface was completely renovated during the flood year `` and thus `` prediluvian topography would have been exceedingly different from postdiluvian topography. `` This implication , they claim , is in conflict with biblical evidence which `` strongly suggests that prediluvian geography did basically resemble postdiluvian geography `` ( Young 1977 , p 210 ) . Reference is made particularly to the topographical descriptions in connection with the Garden of Eden : the lands of Havilah and Cush , and the four rivers , two of which ( the Tigris and the Euphrates ) were familiar to the readers of Genesis in Moses ' time . What is not recognized in these arguments , however , is that although there are some similarities between the prediluvian and postdiluvian topography , there are more differences than similarities . Two of the rivers mentioned apparently no longer existed in Moses ' time : the Pishon and Gihon are mentioned in terms of where they used to flow , in the postdiluvian areas of Havilah and Cush respectively . The other two rivers Â— the Tigris and Euphrates Â— are described as coming from a common source in the Garden of Eden , certainly far different from their present courses . Thus the topographical descriptions in the early chapters of Genesis are in harmony with a world-wide Flood . Also , it is likely that survivors of the Flood would use familiar names for topographical features after the Flood , even though the earth 's surface looked entirely different . Ninth , the duration of the Flood makes sense only with a universal flood . The Deluge of rain from above and water from the fountains of the deep below continued 40 days ( Genesis 7:17 ) , and all the highest mountains were still covered five months after the Flood began ; the tops of the mountains were not seen until after seven months , and the Flood waters were not dried up enough for Noah to leave the ark until one year and ten days had passed ( see Genesis 7:11 ; 8:14 ) . Such lengths of time seem commensurate only with a universal and not a local flood . Tenth , the receding activity of the water ( Genesis 8:3a , 54a ) is described by Hebrew phrases which , in parallel with similar phraseology and grammatical construction for the `` to and fro `` motion of the raven ( Genesis 8:7 ) , should be translated as `` going and retreating , `` ( see Austin 1990 , p 218 ; Hasel 1978 , p 93 ) and imply oscillatory water motion lasting for 74 days ( see Genesis 8:3-5 ) . The waters rushing back and forth like in ocean tidal movement as the overall level gradually decreased , supports a universal interpretation such as `` the oceanic energy impulse model of the flood `` ( Austin 1990 , p 218 ) , but is incongruous with a local flood theory . Eleventh , the NT passages concerning the Flood all employ universal language : `` swept them all away `` ( Matthew 24:39 ) ; `` destroyed them all , `` ( Luke 17:27 ) ; `` he did not spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah with seven other persons , ... when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly `` ( 2 Peter 2:5 ) ; `` a few , that is eight persons , were saved through water `` ( 1 Peter 3:20 ) ; Noah `` condemned the world `` ( Hebrews 11:7 ) . A local flood would not have ended the antediluvian world . As Archer states , `` we have the unequivocal corroboration of the New Testament that the destruction of the human race at the time of the flood was total and universal `` ( Archer 1985 , p 208 ) . Twelfth , the NT Flood typology assumes and depends upon not only the historicity , but also the universality , of the Flood to theologically argue for an imminent world-wide judgment by fire ( 2 Peter 3:6-7 ) . Peter argues that just as there was a world-wide judgment by water causing the unbelieving antediluvian world to perish , so in the antitype there must-needs-be a universal end-time judgment by fire bringing about the destruction of the ungodly ( see Davidson 1981 , p 326-327 ) . Thirteenth , key terms and motifs that we have already noted in Genesis 6-9 converge to make a major theological statement : the Noahic Flood is nothing less than the cosmic undoing or reversal of creation . Numerous biblical scholars have recognized this highly significant theological point of the Flood narrative . Nahum Sarna writes that `` The Flood is a cosmic catastrophe that is actually the undoing of creation. `` In other words , creation is being undone , and the world returned to chaos ( Sarna 1989 , p 48 ) . Tikva Frymer-Kensky describes the Flood as `` the original , cosmic undoing of creation `` ( Frymer-Kensky 1983 , p 410 ; cf . Frymer-Kensky 1985 , p 312 ) . Claus Westermann speaks of the `` invasion of chaos into the created order ; the flood assumed cosmic proportions `` ( Westermann 1974/1984 , p 434 ) . Umberto Cassuto points out that at the high point of the Flood , `` We see water everywhere , as though the world had reverted to its primeval state at the dawn of Creation , when the waters of the Deep submerged everything `` ( Cassuto 1964 , p 97 ) . David Clines uses the apt term bouleversement or `` reversal `` of creation to depict the theological significance of the Flood ( Clines 1972 , p 136 ) . For Joseph Blenkinsopp , ... the deluge is an act of uncreation , undoing the work of separation by returning everything to the primeval , watery chaos from which the created order first arose ( Blenkinsopp 1992 , p 83 ; cf . Blenkinsopp 1971 , p 46-47 ) . Gerhard von Rad vividly underscores the universal implications of this undoing or reversal of creation : ... we must understand the Flood , therefore , as a catastrophe involving the entire cosmos . When the heavenly ocean breaks forth upon the earth below , and the primeval sea beneath the earth , which is restrained by God , now freed from its bonds , gushes up through yawning chasms onto the earth , then there is a destruction of the entire cosmic system according to biblical cosmology . The two halves of the chaotic primeval sea , separated Â— the one up , the other below Â— by God 's creative government ( ch . 1:7-9 ) , are again united ; creation begins to sink into chaos . Here the catastrophe , therefore , concerns not only men and beasts ... but the earth ( chs . 6.13 ; 9.1 ) Â— indeed , the entire cosmos ( von Rad 1972 , p 128 ) . Only a cosmic/universal Flood can theologically encompass the cosmic/universal reversal or undoing of creation described in Genesis 6-9 . Fourteenth and last , the cosmic reversal of creation is followed by a cosmic New Beginning . As Clines states it : ... the 'uncreation ' which God has worked with the Flood is not final ; creation has not been permanently undone . Old unities of the natural world are restored ( 8:22 ) , and the old ordinances of creation are renewed ( 9:1-7 ) ( Clines 1972-73 , p 138 ) . Jacques Doukhan has shown the precise literary parallels between the successive stages of `` re-creation `` in the aftermath of the Flood ( Genesis 8-9 ) and the seven days of creation in Genesis 1-2 ( Doukhan 1987 , p 133-134 ; cf . Gage 1984 , p 10-20 ) : The wind over the earth and waters . Gen. 8:1 ; cf . Gen. 1:2 . Division of waters . Gen. 8:1-5 ; cf . Gen. 1:6-8 . Appearance of plants . Gen. 8:6-12 ; cf . Gen. 1:9-13 . Appearance of light . Gen. 8:13-14 ; cf . Gen. 1:14-19 . Deliverance of animals . Gen. 8:15-17 ; cf . Gen. 1:20-23 . Animals together with men , blessing , food for men , image of God . Gen. 8:18-9:7 ; cf . Gen. 1:24-31 . Sign of covenant . Gen. 9:8-17 ; cf . Gen. 2:1-3 . Thus in the over-arching literary structure of the `` re-creation `` in the Flood narrative , the universal dimension of the Flood is underscored by detailed parallels with the cosmic creation account of Genesis 1-2 . IV . Conclusion In conclusion , the question of the extent of the Genesis Flood is not just a matter of idle curiosity with little at stake for Christian faith . For those who see the days of creation in Genesis 1 as six , literal 24-hour days ( see Hasel 1994 ) , a universal Flood is an absolute necessity to explain the existence of the geologic column . A literal creation week is inextricably linked with a world-wide flood . But a universal Flood is crucial not only in seeking to reconcile science and Scripture . It is also pivotal in understanding and remaining faithful to the theology of Genesis 1-11 and the rest of Scripture . ( For a more detailed discussion of the theology of the Genesis Flood in its canonical context , see Davidson in press . ) The many links with the universal creation in Genesis 1-2 which we have noted in this study not only support the aspect of universality in the Flood , but serve to theologically connect Protology ( Creation ) and Eschatology ( Judgment/Salvation ) in the opening chapters of Scripture . The Flood is an eschatological step-by-step `` uncreation `` of the world and humanity followed by a step-by-step `` re-creation `` of the new world . '' Thus , `` writes von Rad , `` the story of the Flood Â— and this is theologically the most important fact Â— shows an eschatological world judgment .... The world judgment of the Flood hangs like an iron curtain between this world age and that of the first splendor of creation `` ( von Rad 1972 , p 129-130 ) . The theology of the universal Flood is therefore the pivot of a connected but multi-faceted universal theme running through Genesis 1-11 and constituting an over-arching pattern for the entire subsequent world-wide creation revealing the character of the Creator and His original purpose for creation ; humankind 's turning from the Creator and the universal spread of sin ending in the universal `` uncreation `` through eschatological judgment ; and re-creation , in the eschatological salvation of the faithful covenant remnant and the universal renewal of the earth .""",DISAGREE,"""it is We have found fossils , but they are all fake .

And here 's a scholarly article from the biblical perspective that points out the different interpretations Theologians consider , both conservative and liberal . http : //www.grisda.org/origins/22058.htm BIBLICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE GENESIS FLOOD Richard M. Davidson John Nevin Andrews Professor of Old Testament Interpretation Old Testament Department Andrews University , Berrien Springs , Michigan Origins 22 ( 2 ) :58-73 ( 1995 ) . WHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT The extent of the Genesis Flood has been vigorously debated by biblical scholars . For those who accept a recent creation week of six literal consecutive , twenty-four-days , a universal Flood is necessary to explain the existence of the geologic column . The thesis of this study is that only the traditional interpretation which posits a literal , universal , world-wide Genesis Flood does full justice to all the relevant biblical data . The author summarizes twenty-two lines of biblical evidence Â— including terminological , thematic , contextual , grammatical-syntactical , literary-structural , logical-conceptual , theological , canonical , and typological which support the universality of the Genesis Flood .

Conflicting Schools of Interpretation One of the most controversial aspects of the Flood narrative concerns the extent of the Genesis Flood . Three major positions are taken : ( 1 ) the traditional , which asserts the universal , world-wide , nature of the Deluge ; ( 2 ) limited or local flood theories , which narrow the scope of the Flood story to a particular geographical location in Mesopotamia ; and ( 3 ) non-literal ( symbolic ) interpretation , which suggests that the Flood story is a non-historical account written to teach theological truth . Against this third position , the non-historical , we must note the evidences within the biblical account affirming the historical nature of the Flood . In the literary structure of the Flood story ( see Shea 1979 ) , the genealogical frame or envelope construction ( Genesis 5:32 and 9:28-29 ) plus the secondary genealogies ( Genesis 6:9-10 and 9:18-19 ) are indicators that the account is intended to be factual history . The use of the genealogical term tÃ´ledÃ´t ( `` generations , `` `` account `` ) in the Flood story ( 6:9 ) as throughout Genesis ( 13 times , structuring the whole book ) , indicates that the author intended this story to be as historically veracious as the rest of Genesis ( Doukhan 1978 , p 167-220 ) . Walter Kaiser analyzes the literary form of Genesis 1-11 and concludes that this whole section of Genesis must be taken as `` historical narrative prose `` ( Kaiser 1970 ) . A number of references in the book of Job may allude to the then-relatively-recent Flood ( Job 9:5-8 ; 12:14-15 ; 14:11-12 ; 22:15-17 ; 26:10-14 ; 28:9 ; 38:8-11 ; see Morris 1988 , p 26-30 ) . The historical occurrence of the Flood is part of the saving/judging acts of God , and its historicity is assumed and essential to the theological arguments of later biblical writers employing Flood typology ( see Davidson 1981 , p 326-327 ) ; more on this point later . Thus according to the biblical writers , far from being a non-historical , symbolical , or mythical account written only to teach theological truths , the Flood narrative is intended to accurately record a real , literal , historical event . For evangelical Christians who take seriously the biblical record and accept the historicity of the Flood account , the question still remains whether the event described is to be taken as a local , limited flood or a universal , world-wide cataclysm . The limited flood theories rest primarily on scientific arguments that present seemingly difficult geological , biological , and anthropological problems for a universal flood . ( See Boardman 1990 , p 212-223 ; Custance 1979 , p 28-58 ; Kidner 1967 , p 93-95 ; Mitchell 1982/1993 ; Ramm 1954 , p 232-249 ; Young 1977 , p 171-210 ) . Since the scientific argumentation is not the subject of this article , I can only suggest that these problems are not insurmountable , although much more study is needed . A number of studies provides a growing body of evidence for diluvial catastrophism as an alternative to conventional long-age geology ( see Coffin and Brown 1983 ; Roth 1985 , 1986a , 1988 ; Whitcomb 1988 ; Baumgardner 1994a , b ) . The local flood theories further assert that the terminology describing the extent of the Flood should be interpreted in a relative and not absolute universal sense . The various seemingly universal terms are regarded as implying only a limited locality ; they are seen to indicate universality within the writer 's world-view but a limited scope in terms of our modern world view . ( See Boardman 1990 , p 223-226 ; Custance 1979 , p 15-27 ; Kidner 1967 , p 93-95 ; Ramm 1954 , p 241-242 . ) We will take up this issue in the next section of this article . The traditional conservative understanding of the Flood narrative is that Genesis 6-9 describes a universal , world-wide Deluge . It should be noted that this is also the view of the majority of liberal-critical commentators on Genesis 6-9 , although they regard the biblical view as borrowed from the ANE accounts and not historical . ( See Hasel 1975 , p 78 and Note 16 for bibliography of representatives of this position : Fohrer , Koehler , Noth , Procksch , Skinner , Sarna , Speiser , von Rad , Vriezen , Zimmerli , etc . Some of these and other more recent representatives of this view are cited later in this article . ) The thesis of this article is that only the traditional position of a literal , universal world-wide Flood does full justice to the biblical data , and this universal interpretation is crucial for Flood theology in Genesis and for the theological implications drawn by later biblical writers . II . Biblical Terminology in Genesis 6-9 Indicating Universality Perhaps the most important kind of biblical evidence for a universal Flood is the specific all-inclusive terminology found within the Genesis account itself . The late Gerhard Hasel has provided a careful treatment of this terminology in three penetrating studies in previous issues of Origins ( Hasel 1974 , 1975 , 1978 ) , and therefore I need not go into detail in this article . Eight different terms or phrases in Genesis 6-9 , most echoing their counterparts in the world-wide creation account of Genesis 1-2 , indicate universality . First , the term haÃ‰ares `` the earth , `` occurring 46 times in the Flood narrative ( Genesis 6:12 , 13 , 17 , etc . ) , always without any accompanying genitive of limitation , clearly parallels the usage of the same term in the account of world-wide , universal creation in Genesis 1:1 , 2 , 10 . ( While the term at times elsewhere may be used without a genitive and still in context be limited in scope to a certain `` land , `` the explicit link to creation in the Flood account ( see especially Genesis 6:6 , 7 ) clearly gives a universal context for its usage in Genesis 6-9 . ) Some have argued that if Moses had wished to indicate the entire world , he would have used the Hebrew term tebel , which means the world as a whole , or dry land in the sense of continents . This word is never used in the Flood narrative . But it should be pointed out that tebel is never used in the entire Pentateuch , including the creation account . In fact , the term appears no where in the narrative portions of the Hebrew Bible , but only in poetic texts ( 39 times ) usually as a poetic synonym in parallel with haÃ‰ares `` the earth. `` Thus this argument from silence does not adequately consider the contextual and poetic use of terminology , and carries little weight . A second expression , `` upon the face of all the earth `` ÃŒal-penÃª kol-haÃ‰ares ( Genesis 7:3 ; 8:9 ) , clearly alludes to the first occurrence of the same phrase in the universal context of creation ( Genesis 1:29 ; cf . Genesis 1:2 for a related universal expression ) , and thus here also implies a universality of the same dimension , i.e. , the entire surface of the global mass . While the shortened term `` all the earth `` ( kol-haÃ‰ares ) by itself may have a limited meaning elsewhere when indicated by the immediate context ( see Exodus 10:5 , 15 ; Numbers 22:5 , 11 ; 1 Kings 4:34 ; 10:24 ; 2 Chronicles 36:23 ; Genesis 41:57 ) , the immediate context of the Flood story is the universal sinfulness of humankind whom God had made and created ( Genesis 6:6,7 ) to have dominion over `` all the earth `` ( Genesis 1:26 ) , and the succeeding context is the universal dispersal of man after the Tower of Babel `` upon the face of all the earth `` ( Genesis 11:4 , 8 , 9 ) . In each of the four occurrences of the phrase `` upon the face of all the earth `` in Genesis outside the Flood story ( Genesis 1:29 ; 11:4 , 8 , 9 ) , it clearly has the universal sense of the entire land surface of the globe , and there is nothing in the Flood narrative to indicate any less universality . ( It should be also noted that the one place in Genesis where in context a similar phrase `` upon all the face of the earth `` is not universal [ the famine mentioned in Genesis 41:56 ] , the Hebrew has a change in word order from elsewhere in Genesis [ ÃŒal-kol penÃª haÃ‰ares ] ) . Third , the phrase `` face of the ground `` penÃª haÃ‰adamah ( five times in the Flood narrative , 7:4 , 22 , 23 ; 8:8 , 13 ) , occurs in parallel with universal terms we have just noted , `` the earth `` ( 7:23 ) and `` face of all the earth `` ( 8:9 ) ; and this phrase `` face of the ground `` likewise harks back to its first usage in the universal context of creation ( Genesis 2:6 ) . Fourth , the term kol-basar `` all flesh `` occurs 12 times in Genesis 6-9 ( Genesis 6:12 , 13 , 17 , 19 ; 7:16 , 21 ; 8:17 ; 9:11 , 15 , 16 , 17 ) . The word kol `` all `` ( which can occasionally express less than totality if the context demands ) , before an indeterminate noun with no article or possessive suffix , as here in Genesis 6-9 , indicates totality . God 's announcement to destroy `` all flesh `` ( Genesis 6:13 , 17 ) and the narrator 's comment that `` all flesh `` died ( Genesis 7:21-22 ) , except the inhabitants of the ark , indicates universal destruction . The one occurrence of kol plus the determinate noun ha basar `` all the flesh `` ( in Genesis 7:15 ) likewise indicates totality as well as unity . Fifth , the expression `` every living thing `` ( kol-hahay ) of all flesh ( Genesis 6:19 ) , is another expression of totality ; in 7:4 , 23 , the similar term kol-hayeqÃ » m means literally , `` all existence. `` This term is given further universal dimensions by the addition of the clause harking back to creation Â— `` all existence that I have made `` ( 7:4 ) Â— and by the exclusive statement `` Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive `` ( 7:23 ) . As Hasel puts it : There is hardly any stronger way in Hebrew to emphasize total destruction of 'all existence ' of human and animal life on earth than the way it has been expressed . The writer of the Genesis Flood story employed terminology , formulae , and syntactical structures of the type that could not be more emphatic and explicit in expressing his concept of a universal , world-wide flood ( Hasel 1975 , p 86 ) . Sixth , the phrase `` under the whole heaven `` ( tahat kol-haÂšÂšamayim , Genesis 7:19 ) , is used six times in the OT outside of the Flood narrative , and always with a universal meaning ( see Deuteronomy 2:25 ; 4:19 ; Job 28:24 ; 37:3 ; 41:11 ; Daniel 9:12 ) . For example , the phrase is used to describe God 's omniscience : `` For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees under the whole heavens `` ( Job 28:24 ) . Again , it depicts God 's sovereignty : `` Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine `` ( Job 41:11 KJV ) . ( Note that the usage in Deuteronomy 2:25 , describing `` the nations under the whole heaven , `` is further qualified and limited by the phrase `` who shall hear the report of you , `` and thus is potentially universal and not an exception to the universal sense . ) The universal phrase `` under the whole heaven `` or `` under all the heavens `` also universalizes the phrase `` under heaven `` ( Genesis 6:17 ) in this same Flood context . The word `` heaven `` alone can have a local meaning [ e.g. , 1 Kings 18:45 ] , but here the context is clearly universal . Ecclesiastes , which contains numerous allusions to creation , likewise utilizes the term `` under heaven `` with a universal intention ( Ecclesiastes 1:13 ; 2:3 ; 3:1 ; cf . the parallel universal expression `` under the sun `` in Ecclesiastes 1:3 , 9 ; 2:11 , 17 ; etc. ) . In the Flood account this phrase `` under the whole heaven `` is part of two forceful verses describing the extent of the Flood : `` and the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered . The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward , and the mountains were covered `` ( 7:19 , 20 ) . Critical scholar John Skinner notes that 7:19 , 20 `` not only asserts its [ the flood 's ] universality , but so to speak proves it , by giving the exact height of the waters above the highest mountains `` ( Skinner 1930/1956 , p 165 ) . The biblical language here simply can not be explained in terms of a local sky , and certainly can not refer to the local mountains being covered by snow , as some proponents of a local flood suggest . H.C. Leupold points out that the writer of vs. 19 is not content with a single use of kol ( `` all `` ) in `` all the high mountains , `` but `` since 'all ' is known to be used in a relative sense , the writer removes all possible ambiguity by adding the phrase 'under all the heavens . ' A double 'all ' ( kol ) can not allow for so relative a sense . It almost constitutes a Hebrew superlative . So we believe that the text disposes of the question of the universality of the Flood `` ( Leupold 1942 , p 301-302 ) . Seventh , Hasel devoted an entire scholarly article to the phrase `` all the fountains [ maÃŒyenoth ] of the Great Deep [ tehÃ´m rabbah ] `` ( Genesis 7:11 ; 8:2 ) , and showed how it is linked with the universal `` Deep `` ( tehÃ´m ) or world-ocean in Genesis 1:2 ( cf . Psalm 104:6 : `` Thou didst cover it [ the earth ] with deep [ tehÃ´m ] as with a garment ; the waters were standing above the mountains `` ) . The `` breaking up `` and `` bursting forth `` ( i.e. , geological faulting ) of not just one subterranean water spring in Mesopotamia , but of all the `` fountains `` of the Great Deep , coupled in the same verse with the opening of the windows of the heavens , far transcends a local scene . Hasel perceptively concludes that `` the bursting forth of the waters from the fountains of the 'great deep ' refers to the splitting open of springs of subterranean waters with such might and force that together with the torrential downpouring of waters stored in the atmospheric heavens a worldwide flood comes about `` ( Hasel 1974 , p 71 ) . Eighth , in another article , Hasel ( 1978 ) shows how the Hebrew Bible reserved a special term mabbÃ » l which in its 13 occurrences refers exclusively to the universal Genesis Flood ( 12 occurrences in Genesis , once in Psalm 29 : 10 ) . This word may be derived from the Hebrew root ybl `` to flow , to stream. `` The term mabbÃ » l , which in the Flood narrative is usually associated with mayim `` waters , `` seems to have become `` a technical term for waters flowing or streaming forth and as such designates the flood ( deluge ) being caused by waters . ... mabbÃ » l is in the Old Testament a term consistently employed for the flood ( deluge ) which was caused by torrential rains and the bursting forth of subterranean waters `` ( Hasel 1978 , p 92-93 ) . This technical term clearly sets the Genesis Deluge apart from all local floods , and is utilized in the Psalm 29:10 to illustrate Yahweh 's universal sovereignty over the world at the time of the Noahic Flood : `` The Lord sat enthroned at the Flood , and the Lord sits as King forever. `` Summarizing regarding the technical terminology used for the extent of the Flood in Genesis 6-9 , Hasel writes : The Genesis flood narrative provides ample evidence of being an account which is to be understood as a historical narrative in prose style . It expects to be taken literally . There is a consistent and overwhelming amount of terminology and formulae ... which on the basis of context and syntax has uniformly indicated that the flood story wants to be understood in a universal sense : the waters destroyed all human and animal plus bird life on the entire land mass of the globe . To read it otherwise means to force a meaning on the carefully written and specific syntactical constructions of the original language which the text itself rejects ( Hasel 1975 , p 87 ) . III . Other Biblical Evidence for a Universal Flood Many additional lines of biblical evidence converge in affirming the universal extent of the Flood and also reveal the theological significance of this conclusion . We will summarize fourteen points that emerge from the biblical text . First , the trajectory of major themes in Genesis 1-11 Â— Creation , Fall , plan of redemption , spread of sin Â— is universal in scope and calls for a corresponding universal judgment . We have already noted in reference to specific Flood terminology the numerous allusions to the universal context of creation . The creation of `` the heavens and the earth `` certainly is not local in scope according to Genesis 1-2 . Likewise , the Fall of humanity in Adam and Eve led to the sinful condition of the entire human race ( haÃ‰dam ) , not just the inhabitants of Mesopotamia ( see Genesis 6:5 , 11 ; Romans 3:19 ; 5:12 ) . Again , the Protoevangelium ( first Gospel promise ) outlined in Genesis 3:15 , involves the universal moral struggle between the spiritual descendants ( or `` seed `` ) of the serpent and the spiritual descendants ( `` seed `` ) of the woman , culminating in the victory of the representative Messianic Seed over the serpent ( see Robertson 1980 ) . This plan of redemption is certainly universal in scope . In a similar way , the sinful condition of humankind described at the time of the Flood includes more than those living in the Fertile Crescent . From God 's perspective , not simply from the culturally conditioned local view of the narrator , we have the results of the divine investigative judgment : `` And God saw that the wickedness of man ( haÃ‰dam , humankind ) was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually `` ( Genesis 6:5 ) . Such universal sinfulness naturally calls for universal judgment . Second , the divine purpose given for the bringing of the Flood makes explicit its universal scope : `` And the Lord said , ' I will destroy man [ ( haÃ‰dam ) , humanity ] whom I have created from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , creeping things and birds of the air , for I am sorry that I have made them `` ( Genesis 6:7 ) . Nothing less than a complete destruction of the human race ( except for Noah , 6:8 ) seems envisaged . Given the length of time from creation ( over 1650 years minimum ) , the longevity of the antediluvians ( nearly a thousand years ) , and God 's command at creation to `` fill the earth `` ( Genesis 1:28 ) , it is highly unlikely that the pre-Flood population would have stayed only in Mesopotamia . Thus the destruction of humanity would necessitate more than a local Flood . Third , the genealogical lines from both Adam ( Genesis 4:17-26 ; 5:1-31 ) and Noah ( Genesis 10:1-32 ; 11:1-9 ) are exclusive in nature , indicating that as Adam was father of all pre-Flood humanity , so Noah was father of all post-Flood humanity . From the descendants of Noah `` the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood `` ( Genesis 10 : 32 ) , and the Tower of Babel experience spreads humanity across the globe ( Genesis 11:1-19 ) . Striking extra-biblical evidence that all human races , and not just the nations of the Fertile Crescent , are included in the descendants of Noah , and retain memory of the universal Flood , is found in the amazing prevalence of ancient flood stories throughout the world . Over 230 different flood stories are known and occur among the most diverse peoples of the earth ( see Frazer 1918 , 1:105-361 ; Nelson 1931 ) . A world-wide flood is by far the most frequently-given cause for past universally destructive calamities in the folk literature of antiquity ( Thompson 1955 , 1:182-194 ) . A remarkable number of these oral and written traditions agree upon the basic points of the biblical account : all humankind was destroyed by a great flood as a result of divine judgment against human sin , and a single man and his family or a few friends survived the deluge in a ship or other sea-faring vessel . The stories nearest to the area of the Dispersion at Babel are the closest in detail to the biblical account ( see Heidel 1946 , Jacobsen 1981 , and Lambert and Millard 1969 ) . This vast body of ancient witnesses to a world-wide Deluge is powerful testimony to the historicity and universality of the biblical Flood . Fourth , the same inclusive divine blessing to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth is given to both Adam and Noah ( Genesis 1:28 ; 9:1 ) . This is another linkage between universal creation and the flood , between the original beginning and the `` new beginning. `` As the human race at creation flows from Adam and Eve , so the postdiluvial humanity is populated through Noah . Fifth , the covenant ( Genesis 9:9-10 ) with its rainbow sign ( Genesis 9:12-17 ) is clearly linked to the extent of the Flood , and includes the whole earth ( Genesis 9:13-17 ) . If there was only a local flood , then the covenant would be only a limited covenant , and the rainbow sign of `` the all-embracing universality of the Divine mercy `` ( Delitzsch 1888/1976 , 1:289-290 ) would be stripped of its meaning . Sixth , the viability of God 's promise ( Genesis 9:15 ; cf . Isaiah 54:9 ) and the integrity of God in keeping His promise is wrapped up in the world-wide extent of the Flood . This point can not be underscored too heavily : if Genesis 6-9 describes only a local flood , then God has broken His promise every time another local flood has happened ! The only way God 's promise not to send another flood to destroy every living thing ( Genesis 8:21 ) can be seen to have been kept is if the Flood was a universal one and the whole human race outside the ark was destroyed . Seventh , the universality of the Flood is underscored by the enormous size of the ark detailed in Genesis 6:14-15 and the stated necessity for saving all the kinds of animals and plants in the ark ( Genesis 6:16-21 ; 7:2-3 ) . A massive ark filled with representatives of all non-aquatic animal/plant kinds would be unnecessary if this were only a local flood , for these kinds could have been preserved elsewhere in the world . Yet the divine insistence in the biblical record is that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve representatives of all of the various kinds ( Genesis 6:19-20 ) . As a matter of fact , if only a local flood were in view , the building of any ark at all , even for Noah and his family , would have been superfluous Â— God could simply have warned Noah and his family in time to escape from the coming judgment , just as he did with Lot in Sodom . But the point of the narrative concerning the ark is that there was no other escape ; in the midst of the Flood `` only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained `` ( Genesis 7:23 ) . Eighth , the covering of `` all the high mountains `` by at least 15 cubits ( Genesis 7:19-20 ) could not involve simply a local flood , since water seeks its own level across the surface of the globe . Even one high mountain covered in a local Mesopotamian setting would require that same height of water everywhere on the planet 's surface . In this connection we note that it is not necessary to postulate the existence of mountains as high as Mt . Everest at the time of the Flood , and thus to require waters covering the earth to a depth of six miles , as some proponents of a local flood suggest would be necessary ( see Ramm 1954 , p 242 ) . The antediluvian mountains were very possibly much lower than at present . Passages in the book of Job and Psalms may well be referring to the process of postdiluvian mountain uplift ( see Job 9:5 ; 28:9 ; and Psalm 104:7-8 ) . Also in this connection we may address the objection that proponents of a local flood often raise , namely , that a world-wide Flood would imply `` that the earth 's surface was completely renovated during the flood year `` and thus `` prediluvian topography would have been exceedingly different from postdiluvian topography. `` This implication , they claim , is in conflict with biblical evidence which `` strongly suggests that prediluvian geography did basically resemble postdiluvian geography `` ( Young 1977 , p 210 ) . Reference is made particularly to the topographical descriptions in connection with the Garden of Eden : the lands of Havilah and Cush , and the four rivers , two of which ( the Tigris and the Euphrates ) were familiar to the readers of Genesis in Moses ' time . What is not recognized in these arguments , however , is that although there are some similarities between the prediluvian and postdiluvian topography , there are more differences than similarities . Two of the rivers mentioned apparently no longer existed in Moses ' time : the Pishon and Gihon are mentioned in terms of where they used to flow , in the postdiluvian areas of Havilah and Cush respectively . The other two rivers Â— the Tigris and Euphrates Â— are described as coming from a common source in the Garden of Eden , certainly far different from their present courses . Thus the topographical descriptions in the early chapters of Genesis are in harmony with a world-wide Flood . Also , it is likely that survivors of the Flood would use familiar names for topographical features after the Flood , even though the earth 's surface looked entirely different . Ninth , the duration of the Flood makes sense only with a universal flood . The Deluge of rain from above and water from the fountains of the deep below continued 40 days ( Genesis 7:17 ) , and all the highest mountains were still covered five months after the Flood began ; the tops of the mountains were not seen until after seven months , and the Flood waters were not dried up enough for Noah to leave the ark until one year and ten days had passed ( see Genesis 7:11 ; 8:14 ) . Such lengths of time seem commensurate only with a universal and not a local flood . Tenth , the receding activity of the water ( Genesis 8:3a , 54a ) is described by Hebrew phrases which , in parallel with similar phraseology and grammatical construction for the `` to and fro `` motion of the raven ( Genesis 8:7 ) , should be translated as `` going and retreating , `` ( see Austin 1990 , p 218 ; Hasel 1978 , p 93 ) and imply oscillatory water motion lasting for 74 days ( see Genesis 8:3-5 ) . The waters rushing back and forth like in ocean tidal movement as the overall level gradually decreased , supports a universal interpretation such as `` the oceanic energy impulse model of the flood `` ( Austin 1990 , p 218 ) , but is incongruous with a local flood theory . Eleventh , the NT passages concerning the Flood all employ universal language : `` swept them all away `` ( Matthew 24:39 ) ; `` destroyed them all , `` ( Luke 17:27 ) ; `` he did not spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah with seven other persons , ... when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly `` ( 2 Peter 2:5 ) ; `` a few , that is eight persons , were saved through water `` ( 1 Peter 3:20 ) ; Noah `` condemned the world `` ( Hebrews 11:7 ) . A local flood would not have ended the antediluvian world . As Archer states , `` we have the unequivocal corroboration of the New Testament that the destruction of the human race at the time of the flood was total and universal `` ( Archer 1985 , p 208 ) . Twelfth , the NT Flood typology assumes and depends upon not only the historicity , but also the universality , of the Flood to theologically argue for an imminent world-wide judgment by fire ( 2 Peter 3:6-7 ) . Peter argues that just as there was a world-wide judgment by water causing the unbelieving antediluvian world to perish , so in the antitype there must-needs-be a universal end-time judgment by fire bringing about the destruction of the ungodly ( see Davidson 1981 , p 326-327 ) . Thirteenth , key terms and motifs that we have already noted in Genesis 6-9 converge to make a major theological statement : the Noahic Flood is nothing less than the cosmic undoing or reversal of creation . Numerous biblical scholars have recognized this highly significant theological point of the Flood narrative . Nahum Sarna writes that `` The Flood is a cosmic catastrophe that is actually the undoing of creation. `` In other words , creation is being undone , and the world returned to chaos ( Sarna 1989 , p 48 ) . Tikva Frymer-Kensky describes the Flood as `` the original , cosmic undoing of creation `` ( Frymer-Kensky 1983 , p 410 ; cf . Frymer-Kensky 1985 , p 312 ) . Claus Westermann speaks of the `` invasion of chaos into the created order ; the flood assumed cosmic proportions `` ( Westermann 1974/1984 , p 434 ) . Umberto Cassuto points out that at the high point of the Flood , `` We see water everywhere , as though the world had reverted to its primeval state at the dawn of Creation , when the waters of the Deep submerged everything `` ( Cassuto 1964 , p 97 ) . David Clines uses the apt term bouleversement or `` reversal `` of creation to depict the theological significance of the Flood ( Clines 1972 , p 136 ) . For Joseph Blenkinsopp , ... the deluge is an act of uncreation , undoing the work of separation by returning everything to the primeval , watery chaos from which the created order first arose ( Blenkinsopp 1992 , p 83 ; cf . Blenkinsopp 1971 , p 46-47 ) . Gerhard von Rad vividly underscores the universal implications of this undoing or reversal of creation : ... we must understand the Flood , therefore , as a catastrophe involving the entire cosmos . When the heavenly ocean breaks forth upon the earth below , and the primeval sea beneath the earth , which is restrained by God , now freed from its bonds , gushes up through yawning chasms onto the earth , then there is a destruction of the entire cosmic system according to biblical cosmology . The two halves of the chaotic primeval sea , separated Â— the one up , the other below Â— by God 's creative government ( ch . 1:7-9 ) , are again united ; creation begins to sink into chaos . Here the catastrophe , therefore , concerns not only men and beasts ... but the earth ( chs . 6.13 ; 9.1 ) Â— indeed , the entire cosmos ( von Rad 1972 , p 128 ) . Only a cosmic/universal Flood can theologically encompass the cosmic/universal reversal or undoing of creation described in Genesis 6-9 . Fourteenth and last , the cosmic reversal of creation is followed by a cosmic New Beginning . As Clines states it : ... the 'uncreation ' which God has worked with the Flood is not final ; creation has not been permanently undone . Old unities of the natural world are restored ( 8:22 ) , and the old ordinances of creation are renewed ( 9:1-7 ) ( Clines 1972-73 , p 138 ) . Jacques Doukhan has shown the precise literary parallels between the successive stages of `` re-creation `` in the aftermath of the Flood ( Genesis 8-9 ) and the seven days of creation in Genesis 1-2 ( Doukhan 1987 , p 133-134 ; cf . Gage 1984 , p 10-20 ) : The wind over the earth and waters . Gen. 8:1 ; cf . Gen. 1:2 . Division of waters . Gen. 8:1-5 ; cf . Gen. 1:6-8 . Appearance of plants . Gen. 8:6-12 ; cf . Gen. 1:9-13 . Appearance of light . Gen. 8:13-14 ; cf . Gen. 1:14-19 . Deliverance of animals . Gen. 8:15-17 ; cf . Gen. 1:20-23 . Animals together with men , blessing , food for men , image of God . Gen. 8:18-9:7 ; cf . Gen. 1:24-31 . Sign of covenant . Gen. 9:8-17 ; cf . Gen. 2:1-3 . Thus in the over-arching literary structure of the `` re-creation `` in the Flood narrative , the universal dimension of the Flood is underscored by detailed parallels with the cosmic creation account of Genesis 1-2 . IV . Conclusion In conclusion , the question of the extent of the Genesis Flood is not just a matter of idle curiosity with little at stake for Christian faith . For those who see the days of creation in Genesis 1 as six , literal 24-hour days ( see Hasel 1994 ) , a universal Flood is an absolute necessity to explain the existence of the geologic column . A literal creation week is inextricably linked with a world-wide flood . But a universal Flood is crucial not only in seeking to reconcile science and Scripture . It is also pivotal in understanding and remaining faithful to the theology of Genesis 1-11 and the rest of Scripture . ( For a more detailed discussion of the theology of the Genesis Flood in its canonical context , see Davidson in press . ) The many links with the universal creation in Genesis 1-2 which we have noted in this study not only support the aspect of universality in the Flood , but serve to theologically connect Protology ( Creation ) and Eschatology ( Judgment/Salvation ) in the opening chapters of Scripture . The Flood is an eschatological step-by-step `` uncreation `` of the world and humanity followed by a step-by-step `` re-creation `` of the new world . '' Thus , `` writes von Rad , `` the story of the Flood Â— and this is theologically the most important fact Â— shows an eschatological world judgment .... The world judgment of the Flood hangs like an iron curtain between this world age and that of the first splendor of creation `` ( von Rad 1972 , p 129-130 ) . The theology of the universal Flood is therefore the pivot of a connected but multi-faceted universal theme running through Genesis 1-11 and constituting an over-arching pattern for the entire subsequent world-wide creation revealing the character of the Creator and His original purpose for creation ; humankind 's turning from the Creator and the universal spread of sin ending in the universal `` uncreation `` through eschatological judgment ; and re-creation , in the eschatological salvation of the faithful covenant remnant and the universal renewal of the earth .""",DISAGREE,"""much harder to believe We have found fossils , but they are all fake .

Neff 's nomination to a federal district court is among a dozen or so now stalled in the Senate , a logjam in part due to Brownback 's questions about Neff 's attendance at a lesbian commitment ceremony . The Senate Judiciary Committee has already approved her nomination . Neff was traveling outside the country and could not immediately be reached for comment , said Chris Bockheim , her judicial assistant . Earlier this month , Brownback , a prominent opponent of gay marriage who is exploring a presidential run in 2008 , said he would lift the hold he put on Neff 's nomination if the judge agreed to withdraw from ruling on any court case involving the legality of same sex unions . http : //www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/ ... f=rss_politics Does n't this just REEK of hypocrisy and partisanship ? He wants to question this judge because she was PRESENT at a same-sex ceremony . I wonder if similar questions are asked of judges to ensure that they can remain impartial if they view homosexuality as a sin ... `` exploring a presidential run ... `` ? ? ? Sounds like yet another Republican attempt to garner votes off of anti-gay hysteria .""","""Well , this is not very surprising coming from Brownback . I live in Kansas City Missouri , but work over on the Kansas side , so I know plenty about Brownback . He 's been quite a bastard toward gay related issues over the years , and I think the same goes for abortion in his case . If he 's the Republican nominee for the presidential election , boy am I voting Democrat just on that principle , not to mention the fact I have n't voted Republican since George W. You know , maybe they should question judges that have attended hetero marriages as to their impartiality as well as those who attend churches that vocally state their anti-gay views . EDIT : Yep , just checked , and he IS strongly pro-life , having referred to the amount of abortions in the United States since Roe V. Wade as `` a holocaust `` , and is also one of the Kansas officials in favor of teaching Intelligent Design alongside Evolution . He also opposes stem cell research .""",AGREE,"""said he wants Michigan state judge Janet Neff to testify about her role in the 2002 Massachusetts ceremony , her legal views on same-sex unions and her ability to be impartial if called upon to rule on such cases""","""Well , this is not very surprising coming from Brownback ."""

4634,"""Early Christian authorities rejected marriage , for the very reason that it was Goddess-oriented , and also on grounds of eschatology . Since they believed that the world was going to end at any moment , according to JesusÂ ’ promise , they saw no point in continuing another generationÂ–-for their savior specifically stated that the world would end in his own generation ( Luke 9:27 ) . However , as the decades wore on and the world did not end , fathers of the church turned even more firmly against marriage because they thought universal virginity was needed to bring about the promised kingdom of Christ . St. Jerome said the purpose of every godly man should be Â “ to cut down with the ax of Virginity the wood of Marriage.Â ” St. Ambrose called marriage a crime against God . Origen said , Â “ Matrimony is impure and unholy , a means of sexual passion.Â ” Tatian said marriage is Â “ a polluted and foul way of life , Â ” and Tertullian described it as an obscenity , a moral crime , Â “ more dreadful than any punishment or any death.Â ” St. Augustine flatly declared marriage a sin . Saturninus explained that God made only two kinds of people , good men and evil women , and marriage turned good men toward evil . Jesus himself said there could be no marriage in heaven ( Matthew 22:30 , Mark 12:25 ) . St. Bernard wrote that it is easier for a man to bring the dead back to life than to live with a woman without endangering his own soul . For many centuries therefore , marriage remained outside the church , under the auspices of common law . It was grudgingly accepted by religious authorities only when new laws restricted a wifeÂ ’ s rights of ownership and inheritance , taking the means of independence away from women and turning them over to men . Priests had abandoned the early churchÂ ’ s rule of celibacy and had begun to take wives in the 5th and 6th centuries . But in the 11th century , the church decided to forbid clerical marriages , because they produced children to inherit property . When an unmarried priest died , all his property reverted to the church . Therefore , new papal decretals commended clergymen to turn their wives out on the street and sell their children as slaves . Some of the wives stayed on as concubines , though they were disinherited in the churchÂ ’ s favor . By this means the church acquired a great new influx of wealth , although the women and children who were left destitute suffered terribly . Marriage continued under the common law up to the 13th century , having no endorsement by canon law . Historian F.C . Conybeare says , Â “ Nothing is more remarkable than the tardiness with which liturgical forms for the marriage ceremony were evolved by the church.Â ” The earliest approach to a Christian ceremony was a simple blessing of the newlyweds in facie ecclesiaeÂ–-on the porch , outside the church doorÂ–-to prevent the so-called Â “ pollutionÂ ” of GodÂ ’ s house . Though this blessing technically violated canon law , in 1215 the fourth Lateran Council granted it legal status because it had become too popular to ignore . It was only in the 16th century that the church finally made the priestly blessing mandatory ( and , of course lucrative ) , refusing to recognize common-law marriages any more .""","""Freethought Today , November 2008""",DISAGREE,"""Early Christian authorities rejected marriage""","""Freethought Today ,"""

5000,"""South Dakota 's Legislature : Human Life Begins at Conception Susan Jones , CNSNews.com Friday , Feb. 27 , 2004 The South Dakota House on Thursday joined the state Senate in passing a bill that says human life begins at conception Â– something that would outlaw all abortions in South Dakota , except in cases where the mother 's health or life were endangered . Pro-abortion groups called the bill `` a direct assault on South Dakotans ' rights , `` and pro-life advocates see it as a way of directly challenging the Supreme Court 's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized abortion . The bill 's main sponsor , Republican state Rep. Matt McCaulley , called it the `` strongest , cleanest pro-life legislation `` passed by a state legislature since 1973 . Equal Protection He and other supporters say unborn babies deserve equal protection under the 14th Amendment , and they say the state is within its rights to expand the definition of `` persons `` to include unborn babies . '' If this is the case that goes to the Supreme Court to get them to overturn Roe versus Wade , so be it , `` a wire report quoted McCaulley as saying . South Dakota 's pro-life Republican Gov . Mike Rounds has not yet said whether he would sign the bill . He has until March 12 to make up his mind . The bill makes it a crime to perform abortions . The penalties for doing so include up to five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine , unless a mother 's life is in danger . The bill does not include exceptions for rape or incest . McCaulley estimated that about 800 abortions are performed every year in South Dakota . 'Be Very Worried' Every American who `` values a woman 's right to choose `` should be worried , said Kate Michelman , president of NARAL Pro-Choice America , in a press release . Michelman said the bill , if upheld by the courts , could endanger the health of women , send doctors to prison for `` doing what is in the best medical interests of their patients , `` and insert government into personal decisions to the point where some widely used forms of birth control might be banned . '' The anti-choice movement has not been shy about its two-pronged strategy for overturning Roe v. Wade , `` Michelman said . She described the strategy as passing bills like the one in South Dakota , then forcing them into the court system and `` hoping that George Bush has the opportunity to put new justices on the Supreme Court who will take the opportunity that these bills provide them to take away reproductive freedom. `` NARAL Pro-Choice America describes itself as the `` leading national advocate of personal privacy and a woman 's right to choose. ``""","""YES ! !

5811,"""And there are plenty of people who smoke who do n't develop lung cancer . You 're cherry picking . Police are probably much more aggressive than the average citizen , but most of the time their aggression is channeled against the bad guys . And do n't you find it significant that a gun , a symbol and tool of violence , can raise levels of testosterone ? What kind of effect does testosterone have on behavior ? Dogs become more friendly when testosterone is reduced in their bodies through neutering : `` One of the most important behavioral advantages of castration is that as adults , these dogs will tend to be less aggressive both toward other male dogs and also people . The androgen ( male ) hormones , of which testosterone is the most important , are responsible for the development of many behavioral patterns . When young puppies are sexually mounting their 7 and 8-week old litter mates this is because of androgen surges in their bodies .

Is the information that encodes the changes in the environment or within the genes - clearly if you put various organisms into an environment they do not all change the same way . The fish that get larger in the absence of predators are clearly going to react in the opposite way to the predators themselves . The key to the idea here is that they are triggers - things which then cause other things to create the effect we see . Genes are turned on , off or have the amount of expression altered by external effects , Bacteria have whole sets of genes that are generally switched off until the situation triggers them . Does this mean the bacteria have suddenly learned how to produce some essential amino acid , due to the innate property of an amino acid lacking environment , or that the environment has triggered a change in the expression of genes and causing something to happen that was n't happening before ?""",DISAGREE,"""can not be explained by the action of their genes""","""you seem to get confused Genes are turned on , off or have the amount of expression altered"""

6397,"""The genetic code has the remarkable property of error minimization , whereby the arrangement of amino acids to codons is highly efficient at reducing the deleterious effects of random point mutations and transcriptional and translational errors . Whether this property has been explicitly selected for is unclear . Here , three scenarios of genetic code evolution are examined , and their effects on error minimization assessed . First , a simple model of random stepwise addition of physicochemically similar amino acids to the code is demonstrated to result in substantial error minimization . Second , a model of random addition of physicochemically similar amino acids in a codon expansion scheme derived from the Ambiguity Reduction Model results in improved error minimization over the first model . Finally , a recently introduced 213 Model of genetic code evolution is examined by the random addition of physicochemically similar amino acids to a primordial core of four amino acids . Under certain conditions , 22 % of the resulting codes produced according to the latter model possess equivalent or superior error minimization to the standard genetic code . These analyses demonstrate that a substantial proportion of error minimization is likely to have arisen neutrally , simply as a consequence of code expansion , facilitated by duplication of the genes encoding adaptor molecules and charging enzymes . This implies that selection is at best only partly responsible for the property of error minimization . These results caution against assuming that selection is responsible for every beneficial trait observed in living organisms .""","""Also form the article :""",DISAGREE,"""Whether this property has been explicitly selected for is unclear .""","""Also form the article"""

6647,"""Are you claiming that black women are being forced into abortion ? If not , then how is `` genocide `` being committed if they themselves are choosing abortion ?

6832,"""So how would you make a study that shows the benefits of gun ownership ? I donÂ´t think there is any way to do this . It 's already been done to some degree . Do your own research . Sounds like liberal XXXX . Fighting hunger ... tztz No kidding . That 's your U.N. for you , 'cradle to grave ' socialism . Do you think this resistance got their most useful weapons out of a normal store ? Please donÂ´t try such arguments without knowing about European history . Try reading this part again . Also , I did n't write the article . But , let me also state that I 'll 'try ' whatever arguments I see fit . The number of deaths wouldnÂ´t be lower in any way . After all , countries like Rwanda and Sierra Leone donÂ´t have a working governmental strucure so couldnÂ´t enforce such a ban . Is that right ? I 'll tell you what , come at me with a machete and see how close you can get ? Why is gun control more likely to increase crime that reducing it ? It emboldens criminals to commit crimes against what they perceive to be easy targets . How often do pawn shops get robbed ? Not very , as everyone I 've ever been in , the employees all carry a sidearm . Nice try , but DOJ statistics bear this out . Mind telling us about your own `` research `` ? John Lott and others have done extensive research on the issue using DOJ and other statistics . But , it 's irrelevent to liberals like yourself who 'd rather base their opinions on hysterical emotions rather than facts . So , keep relying on Michael Moore and others for your 'research ' . You are right about the people who would give uop their gun . It would be the law-abiding ones , but you are saying this as if they would do something immoral . Huh ? It was obvious that this stupid argument comes up again . Bosnia : People there occasionaly owned guns , but what could a few familiy fathers do when the army comes and shoots everyone . Not much . Oh ? You lived in Bosnia ? Hmm .. I 'm glad a coward like you was n't around when the British 'army ' came calling on the Colonists who were 'family fathers ' . Afghanistan : Do you really think that the Afghanis would have had the same chances against the Soviets without Stingers or CIA training showing them how to plan terrorist attacks ? Sure , without gun control the second-mightiest army would have never attacked Afghanistan ... The Afghans were causing all kinds of grief before we got involved . So , yeah , the Stingers , etc . were a help , but not the deciding factor . Warsaw : That is your most stupid argument and it really makes me angry . In the ghetto of Warsaw , there WAS an armed uprise . The result ? The Germans massacred thousands as revenge . And if they had more guns , maybe the Germans simply had bombed the whole ghetto with their planes . Yeah , it 's stupid to defend yourself . Maybe they were n't as cowardly as yourself and did n't want to die on their knees like you would ? Oh , the Germans did shell and bomb the Ghetto as I recall . And here I thought you were an expert on European history ? Please donÂ´t you ever bring on any arguments against gun-control by showing examples from the 3 . Reich . Gun-control got nothing to do with the increase of HitlerÂ´s power or the way that WW2 went . I 'll bring up whatever I want to , XXXXX . So , cram it ! Once gun-control was established by the Nazis , how were his opponents suppose to overthrow him had they decided to ? Do like you , and put flowers in the barrels of the Storm Trooper 's Mausers ? Give peace a chance ? Yeah , that 'd work ! Also , nowhere in there did it say anything about the 'way WW2 went ' .. you 're just making stuff up . The rest of your post I maybe reply to later , but it is always exhausting to write against any uncited and unproven claims ... What you find 'exhausting ' is your inability to discredit any of John Lott 's points . All you have is your irrational fear of firearms and emotional distortions .

6996,"""Introduction to special issue Testing Our Defenses Stephen J. Simpson and John Travis Figure 1 CREDIT : C. BICKEL/SCIENCE Challenge the immune system , and you might well induce a vigorous response . Challenge an immunologist , and you can be confident of eliciting something rather similar . Indeed , our rate of progress in understanding the immune system has been anything but sluggish over the past few decades . This has encouraged a mood of optimism that new vaccines for infectious diseases and immune-based therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases are just around the corner . Yet despite this brisk pace of discovery and some enticing glimpses of how the immune system might be manipulated , there is much that is clearly left to explore about its inner workings . In this special issue , we consider a selection of fundamental immunological questions that still test investigators . As Casanova and Abel explain ( p. 617 ) , the genetic study of human primary immunodeficiencies is an emerging field that is revealing surprises about our evolving relationship with the world of pathogens . Kioussis and Georgopoulos ( p. 620 ) discuss the epigenetic rules that govern lymphocyte function and development , and , Reiner et al . ( p. 622 ) frame some of the most pertinent issues in T cell fate determination . Cell biology and immunology have long been intimate partners , and Mellman ( p. 625 ) uses the study of antigen presentation to explain how discoveries in basic cell biology continue to underpin our understanding of the immune system . Finally , Sakaguchi and Powrie ( p. 627 ) reveal just how much there is still to learn about the regulatory T cell and its power in preventing overzealous immune responses and autoimmunity . In News , Leslie ( p. 614 ) describes how immunologists have struggled to understand the purpose of mast cells , and Cohen ( p. 612 ) updates the daring efforts of gene therapists to reboot the human immune system with cells impervious to HIV . Science 's STKE focuses on some molecular challenges for immunologists ( www.sciencemag.org/sciext/immunology07 ) . Lind & # 233 ; n describes how the adaptor protein Act1 mediates interleukin-17 receptor signaling . Serfling et al . discuss the importance of NFAT transcription factors to memory lymphocytes . Finally , Wattenberg and Raben describe the negative regulation of various immune responses by diacylglycerol kinase . We are still learning about how immune cells move around the body , and in the research section a Report by Auffrey et al . ( p. 666 ) describes a subset of monocytes that patrol the surfaces of blood vessels for damage and inflammation , contrasting their behavior with that of typical leukocytes . Mueller et al . ( p. 670 ) offer up some intriguing evidence that lymphoid organs `` close up shop `` for new business during an immune response , by using chemokine regulation to prevent the admission of circulating na & # 239 ; ve lymphocytes . In research that may shed some evolutionary light on an ancient system , Chen et al . ( p. 678 and see related News item ) describe how the social amoeba Dictyostelium uses specialized cells akin to phagocytes in animals . Finally , Carmody et al . ( p. 675 ) reveal the means by which normally potent signals mediated by the innate immune Toll-like receptors are placated by blocking ubiquity-nation . With so much left to discover about our immune system , there seems little doubt that immunologists will find plenty to challenge them in the years to come .""","""And its all evolved via NDS - marvellous !""",AGREE,"""CREDIT : C.

Its probably just a lot of people logging on at once messing with the server ( it finds long posts are particularly delicious , make sure you 've copied a version into word before you click reply ) - you 're not going to get told off for reposting anything . - Supersport There has been a radical change in biology , particularly at the molecular level in less than a decade as how knowledge of how genes work has increasived massively in the wake of the human genome project and the advent of 'omic ' technologies . The person who wrote the article really needs to update this as they are quite a bit behind the times working from a 1998 text book - especially if you 're going to be critising approachs to biotech . A huge amount has happened in the ten years since it was written . She 's also using a few odd terms , DNA - > RNA - > Protein is known as the 'Central Dogma ' of molecular biology and does n't really have much to do with what she is talking about , we already know there were some exceptions to this with retroviruses and we 've only recently discovered that RNA plays a lot larger role than just being an intermediate . On top of this , her 'fluid ' genome is part of the central dogma - its only a very simplistic description of what happens in the cell and does n't really go into all the modifications that the protein and RNA undergo that are n't encoded within the gene . Most of the 4 assumptions have just been made up though , Is clearly wrong , as its never been beleived that one protein = one trait . Prior to the human genome project it was thought that each gene encoded one protein ( hence why the estimates for the total number of genes in the human genome were so high ) but we 've always known that proteins interacted with each other than that many genes will only produce a trait in combination with particular allele of another gene - even Mendel knew that and he did n't even know what the 'inherited particles ' were . Again , we 've know pretty much since the first protein structures were worked out that the mRNA does n't directly translate into the protein and that the translated polypeptide is still not the end protein - that they are both cut up and rearranged . Assumption 3 is pretty much accurate , though we have seen some unusual cases that suggest that susceptability to mutation is heritable and even sometimes selected for ( indirectly at least ) . There are also wierder cases of some microorganisms 'stealing ' genes from other nearby organisms in times of stress .

7559,"""The 2nd Amendment was put in place to protect the states from a central government becoming a tyranny just like the one you claim Britain to have been * hence the use of the word militia ... ( of which I have posted court made definitions of on previous posts . ) This law is not a 'natural law ' but one negotiated betwixt various representatives of the colonies/states . Even the amendment re : religion has been changed by the court - in the famous Mormon trail of the late 1800s their freedom of religion was ruled not to extend to the point of polygamy . The statement earlier about the court deciding the law is true . You guys established a referee to determine these matters ; a body of government that 's supposed to be impartial . Most democracies believe that courts can decide . Except in your nation there 's a huge body of opinion that does n't believe this ; if it affects there right to have a penis replacement ... er .... gun . * In these jingoistic terms you Americans forget that you allied yourself with even more repressive governments viz France and Spain in order to get rid of Britain ( France being so monstrously corrupt that it burst into revolution not long afterwards ; Spain too was no bastion of liberty ) Further in your pursuit of 'freedom ' you invaded Canada several times both in the Revolution and in the War of 1812 . Also , it is estimated that only 1/3 of colonials actively supported the cause of revolution - hardly a picture of a people 'yearning to be free ' . The government 'of the people ' was never true in your early history either . George Washington was n't popularly elected . Women did n't get the vote till c.1920 .

8084,"""Court : Seattle police OK to stun pregnant woman By GENE JOHNSON & # 8232 ; ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER SEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket , a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent . Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle 's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone . She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding , and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she 'd be admitting guilt . Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way , the officers decided to arrest her . One reached in , turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor . Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant , but refused to get out , even after they threatened to stun her . The officers - Sgt . Steven Daman , Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times , in the thigh , shoulder and neck , and hauled her out of the car , laying her face-down in the street . Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later , but has permanent scars from the Taser . She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights , and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue . He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks ' rights were clearly violated . But in a 2-1 ruling Friday , a panel of the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed . Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest . The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed , Hall wrote : `` It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment 's notice . Nonetheless , some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained , particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation. `` They also noted that the force used was n't that serious because the Taser was in `` touch `` mode rather than `` dart `` mode , which hurts more . They reversed the lower court 's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit . The officers ' lawyers , Ted Buck and Karen Cobb , said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced . '' Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders , `` Buck said . That 's all the court recognized today . The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances. `` The majority 's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon , who called it `` off the wall. `` '' I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks , let alone three activations of a Taser , in response to such a trivial offense , `` she wrote . She argued that under Washington law , the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody : Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense , and it 's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest . Berzon said the majority 's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves did n't make that legal argument . To obstruct an officer , one must obstruct the officer 's official duties , and the officers ' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her , check for warrants , write up the citation and give it to her . Brooks ' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties , she said . Furthermore , Brooks posed no apparent threat , and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus , or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable , Berzon said . Brooks ' lawyer , Eric Zubel , said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case .

8428,"""As I see it the problem in this country is not guns . The problem is that our society has gotten soft on crime and pretty much gotten to the point of `` no one is responsible for their own behavior `` . Take the law suits against the gun manufacturer 's . Colt comes to mind . Someone used a Colt firearm in a murder and the victim 's family sued Colt for the wrongful death of a family member . The court 's basically said that colt should have known that their products may have been used in a crime and not sold them to someone who could have used it in the commision of a crime . That being the case , why ca n't the auto manufacturer 's be sued when one of their vehicles is used in the commision of a crime ? Why ca n't Ford or Chevy be sued when one of their vehicles is used in a DUI vehicular homicide ? The reasoning I have read is that the auto maker 's are unable to control the end use of their products . So how can one manufacturer be held responsible for the end use of their product and not another ? Another case in point . Less than a hundred years ago , if you were convicted of a murder you were sentenced to death and the sentence was carried out . Now if you murder somebody , you can plea bargain it down to involuntary manslaughter , get sentenced to 18 to 23 months , and be paroled in 9 to 12 month 's on good behavior . Now some would say the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment . To them I put this question . What do you call kidnapping a child from her bedroom , raping and sodomizing her , putting her on a hot engine block , then strangling her . Do n't know about the rest of society , but that qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment in my book . By the way , the guy that did this was sentenced to life in prison on the taxpayer 's dime . No longer does the punishment fit the crime in this country . We have put a price tag on human life and I must say it is a damn cheap one . Guns are not the problem in this country . The problem is a government who trying to erode our rights to further their own agenda . Now for those who say we have a police force to protect us , if you would actually read their purpose , you would see that the police force has no duty to protect the individual , only the public in general . I have quite a few friends at the local state police barracks and in general they are opposed to gun control . Most police organization who are for gun control who are for gun control are politically motivated . For those who are going to say I 'm a right wing nut job , I 'll give you this . I served my country in various special operations forces . I can not go into anymore more detail than i 'll give you here , so please do n't ask . Automatic weapons were designed for assualt purposes so I will give you that one . However , as a highly decorated combat veteran I will say this . The most dangerous and demoralizing weapon ever made was a sniper rifle . Death can come from anywhere at anytime . Most have an effective range well over any automatic weapon . Sniper rifles are basically modified hunting rifles that can be duplicated by any gunsmith worth his salt . The effective range on a 5.56mm round ( basically a .223 remington ) fired from an M-16 ( or An AR-15 ) is just over 450 meters . A 7.62 x 54 mm round ( a .308 , a very popular hunting round ) is about 1200 meters . To put this in perspective there is just over 1700 meters in a mile . I do carry a M1911 Colt .45 as a concealed carry weapon . After reading some of the other posts here , I must say I am deeply offended by someone saying that because I carry a CCW I 'm going to shoot someone over a fender bender . I will say that their are some who should n't be carrying a CCW . And I do take responsibilty for my weapons . Unfortunately . I have had to use my weapon on a couple of occasions . Most of the time simply brandishing the weapon and taking control of the situation is enough to end it in a positive way . Only once have I had to discharge my weapon in self defense . By the way , the criminal in on the receiving end of that one had a very long and violent criminal history . I have shed the same blood in the same mud as alot of others to insure that EVERYONE in this country has the freedom to have their own opinions about things . That is a right guarenteed in The Constitution of the United States . Just as it is a right for me to own arms of my choice . Some would say that my RKBA is outdated . To them I ask , what if I think your right to free speech or freedom to religion is outdated ? Should it be changed too ? There are no easy solutions to the problem we as a society are facing . But blaming guns or free speech for our problems is like saying flies cause garbage . It is easy to blame guns for our problems . But they are merely a tool , like a shovel , that unless put into use by a person or persons . it merely just sits there and does nothing . Our society has pushed the issue of not being responsible or held accoutable for your actions way to far . I do have a solution to these problems , but most would find it offensive . What the hell , I 've probably offended alot already , so here goes . We have a three time loser law , that if you have three felony convictions you are considered a career criminal . Now alot of those crimes involve firearms . So if you are convicted of three felony firearms crimes , you should get the death penalty to be carried out immediately . It will take some time to get the message across but iI do believe when the message gets out , firearms crimes will be reduced drastically . Well , I need to get some things done so I 'll write more later . Later all ......""","""I think you hit it pretty much on the money . Gun control does not cure anger , hate , and violence .

8428,"""As I see it the problem in this country is not guns . The problem is that our society has gotten soft on crime and pretty much gotten to the point of `` no one is responsible for their own behavior `` . Take the law suits against the gun manufacturer 's . Colt comes to mind . Someone used a Colt firearm in a murder and the victim 's family sued Colt for the wrongful death of a family member . The court 's basically said that colt should have known that their products may have been used in a crime and not sold them to someone who could have used it in the commision of a crime . That being the case , why ca n't the auto manufacturer 's be sued when one of their vehicles is used in the commision of a crime ? Why ca n't Ford or Chevy be sued when one of their vehicles is used in a DUI vehicular homicide ? The reasoning I have read is that the auto maker 's are unable to control the end use of their products . So how can one manufacturer be held responsible for the end use of their product and not another ? Another case in point . Less than a hundred years ago , if you were convicted of a murder you were sentenced to death and the sentence was carried out . Now if you murder somebody , you can plea bargain it down to involuntary manslaughter , get sentenced to 18 to 23 months , and be paroled in 9 to 12 month 's on good behavior . Now some would say the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment . To them I put this question . What do you call kidnapping a child from her bedroom , raping and sodomizing her , putting her on a hot engine block , then strangling her . Do n't know about the rest of society , but that qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment in my book . By the way , the guy that did this was sentenced to life in prison on the taxpayer 's dime . No longer does the punishment fit the crime in this country . We have put a price tag on human life and I must say it is a damn cheap one . Guns are not the problem in this country . The problem is a government who trying to erode our rights to further their own agenda . Now for those who say we have a police force to protect us , if you would actually read their purpose , you would see that the police force has no duty to protect the individual , only the public in general . I have quite a few friends at the local state police barracks and in general they are opposed to gun control . Most police organization who are for gun control who are for gun control are politically motivated . For those who are going to say I 'm a right wing nut job , I 'll give you this . I served my country in various special operations forces . I can not go into anymore more detail than i 'll give you here , so please do n't ask . Automatic weapons were designed for assualt purposes so I will give you that one . However , as a highly decorated combat veteran I will say this . The most dangerous and demoralizing weapon ever made was a sniper rifle . Death can come from anywhere at anytime . Most have an effective range well over any automatic weapon . Sniper rifles are basically modified hunting rifles that can be duplicated by any gunsmith worth his salt . The effective range on a 5.56mm round ( basically a .223 remington ) fired from an M-16 ( or An AR-15 ) is just over 450 meters . A 7.62 x 54 mm round ( a .308 , a very popular hunting round ) is about 1200 meters . To put this in perspective there is just over 1700 meters in a mile .

The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general , and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates . ( 45 Crime and Delinquency 481-93 ( 1999 ) ) . Deterrence , Brutalization , and the Death Penalty : Another Examination of OklahomaÃ•s Return to Capital Punishment . In this study , author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma , it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder , such as felony-murder , stranger robbery-related killings , stranger non-felony murder , and argument-related killings , before and after the resumption of executions . Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing . After controlling for a number of variables , Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect . He did , however , find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium .

9277,"""One other point . The beauty of science is that it 's based on repeatable evidence . If I do a nifty experiment I can describe it to you , and you can do it yourself . If you do n't get the same results then my conclusions are suspect . One of the defining characteristics of the supernatural is that it does n't work on demand . So while convincing evidence might appear once , it 's unlikely to appear again . This does n't automatically mean that the supernatural is n't real , or that the original evidence is bogus . It does mean that scientific methods are n't necessarily the right tools to use to judge the supernatural . Science deals with laws , with constants . The supernatural is by definition a bit more flaky .""","""One can not have a controled experiment , as one can in the hard sciences . Psychology , anthropology and other disciplines also do not allow for controlled experiments .

If she 's a real victim and willing to make an ad , why not give her name to personalize her message ? And are you actually suggesting that it 's ok to justify the killing of at least 1.3 million other babies per year because less than 1 % of the women who get abortions were raped ? HERE 'S the 1 % statistic . And Here 's searching beyond the myths . Rape , Incest and Abortion : Searching Beyond the Myths David C. Reardon , Ph.D. `` How can you deny an abortion to a twelve-year-old girl who is the victim of incest ? `` complains an indignant supporter of abortion . '' And how can you call yourself a loving Christian if you would force a victim of violent rape to give birth to a rapist 's child ? `` Every pro-lifer has heard these same challenges in one form or another . They are the emotionally charged questions designed to prove either 1 ) that pro-lifers are insensitive `` fetus lovers , `` 2 ) or ethically inconsistent , allowing abortion for some circumstances but not others . Unfortunately , most pro-lifers have difficulty answering these challenges because the issue of sexual assault pregnancies is so widely misunderstood . Typically , both sides of the debate accept the presumption that women with sexual assault pregnancies would want an abortion and that the abortion would in some way help them to recover from the assault . Thus , the pro-lifer is left in the uncomfortable position of arguing that the sanctity of life is more important than the needs of the sexual assault victim with whom everyone should rightly sympathize . But in fact , the welfare of the mother and child are never at odds , even in sexual assault cases . Both the mother and child are helped by preserving life , not by perpetuating violence . The reason most people reach the wrong conclusion about abortion in cases of rape and incest is that the actual experiences of sexual assault victims who became pregnant are routinely left out of the debate . Most people , including sexual assault victims who have never been pregnant , are therefore forming opinions based on prejudices and fears which are disconnected from reality . For example , it is commonly assumed that rape victims who become pregnant would naturally want abortions . But in the only major study of pregnant rape victims ever done , Dr. Sandra Mahkorn found that 75 to 85 percent chose against abortion.1 This evidence alone should cause people to pause and reflect on the presumption that abortion is wanted or even best for sexual assault victims . Several reasons are given for not aborting . First , approximately 70 percent of all women believe abortion is immoral , even though many also feel it should be a legal choice for others . Approximately the same percentage of pregnant rape victims believe abortion would be just another act of violence perpetrated against their bodies and their children . Second , some believe that their child 's life may have some intrinsic meaning or purpose which they do not yet understand . This child was brought into their lives by a horrible , repulsive act . But perhaps God , or fate , will use the child for some greater purpose . Good can come from evil . Third , victims of assault often become introspective . Their sense of the value of life and respect for others is heightened . They have been victimized , and the thought that they in turn might victimize their own innocent child through abortion is repulsive . Fourth , at least at a subconscious level , the victim may sense that if she can get through the pregnancy , she will have conquered the rape . By giving birth , she can reclaim some of her lost self-esteem . Giving birth , especially when conception was not desired , is a totally selfless act , a generous act , a display of courage , strength and honor . It is proof that she is better than the rapist . While he was selfish , she can be generous . While he was destroying , she can be nurturing . If giving birth builds self respect , what about abortion ? This is a question which most people fail to even consider . Instead , most people assume that an abortion will at least help a rape victim put the assault behind her and go on with her life . But in jumping to this conclusion , the public is adopting an unrealistic view of abortion . Abortion is not some magical surgery which turns back time to make a woman `` un-pregnant. `` Instead , it is a real life event which is always very stressful and often traumatic . Once we accept that abortion is itself an event with ramifications on a woman 's life , then we must carefully look at the special circumstances of the pregnant rape victim . Will an abortion truly console her , or will it only cause further injury to her already bruised psyche ? In answering this question , it is helpful to begin by noting that many women report that their abortions felt like a degrading and brutal form of medical rape.2 This association between abortion and rape is not hard to understand . Abortion involves a painful examination of a woman 's sexual organs by a masked stranger who is invading her body . Once she is on the operating table , she loses control over her body . If she protests and asks for the abortionist to stop , she will likely be ignored or told : `` It 's too late to change your mind . This is what you wanted . We have to finish now. `` And while she lies there tense and helpless , the life hidden within her is literally sucked out of her womb . The difference ? In a sexual rape , a woman is robbed of her purity ; in this medical rape she is robbed of her maternity . This experiential association between abortion and sexual assault is very strong for many women . It is especially strong for women who have a prior history of sexual assault , whether or not she is presently pregnant as the result of an assault.3 This is just one reason why women with a history of sexual assault are likely to experience greater distress during and after an abortion than other women . Second , research shows that after any abortion , it is common for women to experience guilt , depression , feelings of being `` dirty , `` resentment of men , and lowered self-esteem . What is most significant is that these feelings are identical to what women typically feel after rape . Abortion , then , only adds to and accentuates the traumatic feelings associated with sexual assault . Rather than easing the psychological burdens of the sexual assault victim , abortion adds to them . This was the experience of Jackie Bakker , who reports : `` I soon discovered that the aftermath of my abortion continued a long time after the memory of my rape had faded . I felt empty and horrible . Nobody told me about the pain I would feel deep within causing nightmares and deep depressions . They had all told me that after the abortion I could continue my life as if nothing had happened. `` Those encouraging abortion often do so because they are uncomfortable dealing with rape victims , or perhaps out of prejudice against victims whom they see as being `` guilty for letting it happen. `` Wiping out the pregnancy is a way of hiding the problem . It is a `` quick and easy `` way to avoid dealing with the woman 's true emotional , social and financial needs . According to Kathleen DeZeeuw , `` I , having lived through rape , and also having raised a child 'conceived in rape , ' feel personally assaulted and insulted every time I hear that abortion should be legal because of rape and incest . I feel that we 're being used by pro-abortionists to further the abortion issue , even though we 've not been asked to tell our side. `` The case against abortion of incest pregnancies is even stronger . Studies show that incest victims rarely ever voluntarily agree to an abortion.4 Instead of viewing the pregnancy as unwanted , the incest victim is more likely to see the pregnancy as a way out of the incestuous relationship because the birth of her child will expose the sexual activity . She is also likely to see in her pregnancy the hope of bearing a child with whom she can establish a true loving relationship , one far different than the exploitive relationship in which she has been trapped . But while the incest victim may treasure her pregnancy because it offers her hope of release , and the hope of finding a nurturing love , her pregnancy is a threat to the exploiter . It is also a threat to the pathological secrecy which may envelop other members of the family who are afraid to acknowledge that the abuse is occurring . Because of this dual threat , the victim may be coerced into an unwanted abortion by both the abuser and other family members . For example , Edith Young , a 12-year-old victim of incest impregnated by her stepfather , writes twenty-five years after the abortion of her child : `` Throughout the years I have been depressed , suicidal , furious , outraged , lonely , and have felt a sense of loss ... The abortion which was to 'be in my best interest ' just has not been . As far as I can tell , it only 'saved their reputations , ' 'solved their problems , ' and 'allowed their lives to go merrily on. ' ... My daughter , how I miss her so . I miss her regardless of the reason for her conception. `` Abortion providers who ignore this evidence , and neglect to interview minors presented for abortion for signs of coercion or incest , are actually contributing to the young girl 's victimization . They are not only robbing the victim of her child , they are concealing a crime , abetting a perpetrator , and handing the victim back to her abuser so that the exploitation can continue . Finally , we must recognize that the children conceived through sexual assault also have a voice which deserves to be heard . Julie Makimaa , conceived by an act of rape , works diligently against the perception that abortion is acceptable or even necessary in cases of sexual assault . While sympathetic to the suffering her mother endured at the hands of her attacker , Julie is also rightfully proud of her mother 's courage and generosity . Regarding her own view of her origin , Julie proclaims : `` It does n't matter how I began . What matters is who I will become. `` That 's a slogan we can all live with .""",DISAGREE,"""But Governor Palin does n't think so""","""If she 's a real victim and willing to make an ad , why not give her name to personalize her message ?

Glover 's research in the area of fetal pain is hardly groundbreaking . Sir Albert W. Liley , the pre-eminent fetologist from New Zealand , had no doubt , on the basis of objective evidence , that the fetus has a capacity to feel pain . In 1963 , Dr. Liley , the founder of fetology , developed the first surgical technique for administering intrauterine blood transfusions to the fetus . According to Liley , the fetus feels pain as early as three months . In offering instructions for carrying out the surgical technique of fetal blood transfusions , he advised his colleagues to take into serious consideration this fact of fetal pain . During the actual surgical procedure , the child must be sedated and given pain-relieving medication . Dr. Margaret Liley , wife and assistant to her husband , and a distinguished fetologist and pediatrician in her own right , remarks in her well-known book , Modern Motherhood : When doctors first began invading the sanctuary of the womb , they did not know that the unborn baby would react to pain in the same fashion as a child would . But they soon learned that he would . By no means a Â ‘ vegetable ' as he has so often been pictured , the unborn knows perfectly well when he has been hurt , and he will protest it just as violently as would a baby in a crib . In referring to aborting a 12-week-old fetus by dilatation and curettage , ( in which the neck of the womb is dilated and the fetus removed in pieces after the womb has been scraped by a sharp instrument called a curette ) , Dr. Eugene Diamond stated in 1971 : `` When this procedure is done , there is little doubt that the fetus , in fact , feels what is done to it. `` In a comprehensive treatment of fetal pain , published in 1985 in the New England Journal of Medicine , Dr. K. Annand , a Harvard physiologist , stated that the fetus first perceives pain as early as 12 weeks . In a May 1975 piece in Atlantic , Willard Gaylin and Marc Lappe argue for fetal experimentation , which they contend is far less traumatic for the unborn than certain forms of abortion . If society allows a child in the womb to be subjected to `` unimaginable acts of violence , `` they write , such as `` dismemberment , salt-induced osmotic shock , or surgical extirpation , `` how can it balk at fetal experimentation , most forms of which are incomparably more benign . Fetal pain , of course , is a matter of fact , not ideology . Science , of course , should be based on fact , not political correctness . We live in a Therapeutic Culture in which popping pills has become a national pastime . We are only too sensitive about pain , inconvenience , and possibly offending someone . Yet our own ultra-sensitivity to pain does not , in general , extend to the unborn . Are we inconsistent in our war against pain ? Is there a blatant contradiction that runs through the very heart of our Therapeutic Culture ? The answer to this apparent dilemma lies in the fact that there are different levels of pain . Pain exists on a spiritual as well as on a physical level . Of the two , as many psychologists and psychiatrists have averred , the spiritual kind is more difficult to bear . The difference between the two is akin to the difference between pain and suffering . The suffering in one 's soul that can arise from humiliation , guilt , despair , and terror , are formidable . An athlete would rather risk breaking his neck driving for a fly ball than feel the humiliation of being called a wimp . A soldier would rather risk injury and even death , than suffer the shame of dishonor . A Christian would rather mortify himself than experience the disgrace that comes with mortal sin . Defeat , dishonor , disgrace , as a rule , are far more devastating than physical pain . There is a pain that goes with being egregiously wrong ( shame ) or being recklessly immoral ( disgrace ) or being purposely obtuse ( humiliation ) that is more acute than physical pain . Our Therapeutic Culture is not inconsistent . Those who promote abortion want to spare themselves the pain that goes with suffering shame , disgrace , and humiliation . Because of that , they are willing to deny the pain that the aborted baby feels . To acknowledge what abortion really means is too painful for them . They would rather retreat into the presumed security of their comforting ideology . Pain and birth go together in a mysterious way , like death and life , fall and redemption . The birth of a child or the rebirth of an adult requires a certain amount of pain . Birth and redemption both demand pain . Abortion was instituted in an attempt to avoid pain . But it has magnified the very thing it had sought to reduce . We are drowning in a sea of tranquilizers while we increase our suffering . We thought we could eliminate physical suffering , but brought about spiritual torment . The abortion issue , like an ellipse , has two foci : one is the birth of the child ( which is accompanied by pain ) ; the other , the rebirth of the pro-abortionist ( which is accompanied by suffering ) . Part of the painful truth about the abortion issue is that it includes both the unborn and the unrepentant. `` Dr. DeMarco is a professor of philosophy at St. Jerome 's University in Waterloo , Ont .""",DISAGREE,"""sufficiently developed cerebral cortex stimulus are simply reflex action when seeing the leg of a newly dead frog move under stimulus""","""Fetal Pain : A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence , `` foreign instrument or needle into the uterus to apply pressure `` unimaginable acts of violence , `` suffering shame , disgrace , and humiliation Part of the painful truth about the abortion issue is that it includes both the unborn and the"""

Answer : I can only say that the fetus responds violently to stimuli that you and I would find painful . Bertrand Russell once remarked that a fisherman had told him that fish had neither sense or sensation , but how he knew that the fisherman would not tell him. `` The following excerpt is from : http : //www.theinterim.com/2000/nov/21fetalpain.html `` Dr . Glover 's research in the area of fetal pain is hardly groundbreaking . Sir Albert W. Liley , the pre-eminent fetologist from New Zealand , had no doubt , on the basis of objective evidence , that the fetus has a capacity to feel pain . In 1963 , Dr. Liley , the founder of fetology , developed the first surgical technique for administering intrauterine blood transfusions to the fetus . According to Liley , the fetus feels pain as early as three months . In offering instructions for carrying out the surgical technique of fetal blood transfusions , he advised his colleagues to take into serious consideration this fact of fetal pain . During the actual surgical procedure , the child must be sedated and given pain-relieving medication . Dr. Margaret Liley , wife and assistant to her husband , and a distinguished fetologist and pediatrician in her own right , remarks in her well-known book , Modern Motherhood : When doctors first began invading the sanctuary of the womb , they did not know that the unborn baby would react to pain in the same fashion as a child would . But they soon learned that he would . By no means a Â ‘ vegetable ' as he has so often been pictured , the unborn knows perfectly well when he has been hurt , and he will protest it just as violently as would a baby in a crib . In referring to aborting a 12-week-old fetus by dilatation and curettage , ( in which the neck of the womb is dilated and the fetus removed in pieces after the womb has been scraped by a sharp instrument called a curette ) , Dr. Eugene Diamond stated in 1971 : `` When this procedure is done , there is little doubt that the fetus , in fact , feels what is done to it. `` In a comprehensive treatment of fetal pain , published in 1985 in the New England Journal of Medicine , Dr. K. Annand , a Harvard physiologist , stated that the fetus first perceives pain as early as 12 weeks . In a May 1975 piece in Atlantic , Willard Gaylin and Marc Lappe argue for fetal experimentation , which they contend is far less traumatic for the unborn than certain forms of abortion . If society allows a child in the womb to be subjected to `` unimaginable acts of violence , `` they write , such as `` dismemberment , salt-induced osmotic shock , or surgical extirpation , `` how can it balk at fetal experimentation , most forms of which are incomparably more benign . Fetal pain , of course , is a matter of fact , not ideology . Science , of course , should be based on fact , not political correctness . We live in a Therapeutic Culture in which popping pills has become a national pastime . We are only too sensitive about pain , inconvenience , and possibly offending someone . Yet our own ultra-sensitivity to pain does not , in general , extend to the unborn . Are we inconsistent in our war against pain ? Is there a blatant contradiction that runs through the very heart of our Therapeutic Culture ? The answer to this apparent dilemma lies in the fact that there are different levels of pain . Pain exists on a spiritual as well as on a physical level . Of the two , as many psychologists and psychiatrists have averred , the spiritual kind is more difficult to bear . The difference between the two is akin to the difference between pain and suffering . The suffering in one 's soul that can arise from humiliation , guilt , despair , and terror , are formidable . An athlete would rather risk breaking his neck driving for a fly ball than feel the humiliation of being called a wimp . A soldier would rather risk injury and even death , than suffer the shame of dishonor . A Christian would rather mortify himself than experience the disgrace that comes with mortal sin . Defeat , dishonor , disgrace , as a rule , are far more devastating than physical pain . There is a pain that goes with being egregiously wrong ( shame ) or being recklessly immoral ( disgrace ) or being purposely obtuse ( humiliation ) that is more acute than physical pain . Our Therapeutic Culture is not inconsistent . Those who promote abortion want to spare themselves the pain that goes with suffering shame , disgrace , and humiliation . Because of that , they are willing to deny the pain that the aborted baby feels . To acknowledge what abortion really means is too painful for them . They would rather retreat into the presumed security of their comforting ideology . Pain and birth go together in a mysterious way , like death and life , fall and redemption . The birth of a child or the rebirth of an adult requires a certain amount of pain . Birth and redemption both demand pain . Abortion was instituted in an attempt to avoid pain . But it has magnified the very thing it had sought to reduce . We are drowning in a sea of tranquilizers while we increase our suffering . We thought we could eliminate physical suffering , but brought about spiritual torment . The abortion issue , like an ellipse , has two foci : one is the birth of the child ( which is accompanied by pain ) ; the other , the rebirth of the pro-abortionist ( which is accompanied by suffering ) . Part of the painful truth about the abortion issue is that it includes both the unborn and the unrepentant. `` Dr. DeMarco is a professor of philosophy at St. Jerome 's University in Waterloo , Ont .""",DISAGREE,"""Otherwise , the movements of an early fetus or embryo away from a stimulus are simply reflex action""","""We thought we could eliminate physical suffering , but brought about spiritual torment ."""

( Nevermind that the crux of ID is that it demands an evolutionary mechanism for the appearance of alleged IC/ `` unevolvable `` systems ; the ID philosophy totally sidesteps that requirement . ) 3 ) Again , the validity of ID depends not on the designer 's choices but only on the designer interacting at all . 4 ) OEC/IDists will claim that environmental conditions have changed over millions of years just like mainstream science says they have ; after all , some IDists `` do n't doubt `` mechanisms such as natural selection .

Appropriately , because ID as a whole is essentially an argument from ignorance , ignorance plays a role the answers to all your questions .

Also notice that none of the statements are testable or falsifiable , except for the parts of the OEC view that are perfectly compatible with geology and evolution . Some will claim that they `` have no reason `` to doubt common descent ( a la Behe ) but do a conspicuously good job of not saying they actually believe it .
