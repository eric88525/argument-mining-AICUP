582,"""The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated ( regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution ) . In our own day , I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated . Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated : `` It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects , whenever they were called into service for the public defense . It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army ; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness . This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority . It is , therefore , with the most evident propriety , that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union `` to provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS , AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS. `` The Federalist Papers - THOMAS ( Library of Congress ) We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia , have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state .

621,"""If marriage is so sacred socially , then heterosexuals who get married should never divorce , and quickie marriages that celebrities have all of the time should n't be allowed ( Not to mention things like Joe Millionaire and the Bachelorette ) . This should n't be a social issue because if it is , it 's allowing the government to make individuals to adhere to a set of moral codes that only a select group believes . The government should approach this as a legal matter , which it is , and allow the legally binding marriage of homosexuals which affords them the same benefits that every other couple who pays 80 bucks to a local courthouse can enjoy . If you have a problem with it socially , then you probably also have a problem with homosexuals in the first place , and thats a problem that you need to deal with on your own . Otherwise , keep your mouth shut and let the government dole out legal unions ( or dare I say `` marriages `` ) to same sex couples and let that be the end of it . If the word marriage bothers you so much because of the religious background of the word , get over it . The word is a useful way to describe the legal binding of any two individuals who may have a different faith than the one where some claim the word 's definition is derived from .

2239,"""The Bible only refers to `` high hills `` , and the mountains today wre formed only towards the end of , and after , the Flood by collision of the tectonic plates and the associated upthrusting . In support of this , the layers that form the uppermost parts of Mt Everest themselves of fossil-bearing , water-deposited layers . This uplift of the new continental land-masses from under the Flood waters would have meant that , as the mountains rose and the valleys sank ( as Psalm 104 suggests ) , the waters would have rapidly drained off the newly emerging land surfaces . The collapse of natural dams holding back the floodwaters on the land would also have caused catastrophic flooding . Such rapid movement of large volumes of water would have caused extensive erosion and shaped the basic features of today 's Earth surface . As a result of this extensive erosion ( caused by the retreating Flood waters ) it is not hard to envisage the rapid carving of the landscape features that we see on the Earth today , including places such as the Grand Canyon of the U.S.A . The present shape of Uluru , a sandstone monolith in central Australia , is the result of erosion , following the tilting and uplife , of previously horizontal beds of water-laid sand . The feldspar-rich sand that makes up Uluru must have been deposited very quickly and recently . Long-distance transport of the sand would have caused the grains to be rounded and sorted , but we do n't see this at Uluru , i.e . they are jagged and unsorted . Which indicates rapid transportation ( like through a cataclystic Flood ) . If they had sat accumulating slowly in a lake bed drying in the sun over eons of years , which is the story told in the geological display at the park centre , the feldspar would have weathered into clay . Likewise , if Uluru had sat in hte once-humid area of central Australia for millions of years , it would have weathered to clay . But besides the `` fact `` that it has reportedly been exposed to weathering for hundreds of millions of years , the feldspars are still very fresh , as though they were exposed only yesterday . Similarly , the nearby Kata Tjuta are composed of an unsorted mixture of large boulders , sand and mud , indicating that the material must have been transported and deposited very rapidly . Receding floodwaters eroded the land , creating river valleys . This explains why rivers are often so much smaller than the valleys they flow in today - they did not carve the valleys . The water flow that carved out the river valleys must have been far greater than the volume of water we see flowing in the rivers today . This is consistent with voluminous Flood waters draining off the emerging land surfaces at the cose of Noah 's Flood , and flowing into the rapidly sinking , newly prepared , deep ocean basins .

Brief Reviews Arteriosclerosis , Thrombosis & amp ; Vascular Biology . 26 ( 6 ) :1236-1245 , June 2006 . Rip , Jaap ; Nierman , Melchior C. ; Ross , Colin J. ; Jukema , Jan Wouter ; Hayden , Michael R. ; Kastelein , John J.P. ; Stroes , Erik S.G. ; Kuivenhoven , Jan Albert Abstract : mdash ; : Lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) hydrolyzes triglycerides in the circulation and promotes the hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins . Since the gene was cloned in 1989 , more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified , the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function . In contrast to this , the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation . This notion combined with the facts that 20 % of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL and that it may protect against cardiovascular disease has led to extensive clinical and basic research into this frequent LPL mutant . It is only until recently that we begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects associated with LPLS447X . This review summarizes the current literature on this interesting LPL variant . This one provides rather good protection from hardening of the arteries .

Two new enzyme activities , 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase , were detected in the adapted strains . http : //aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/61/5/2020.pdf We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon ( because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest ) but it took less than a century .

3183,"""There are a few fictional works which addressed this possibility and brought up interesting points . One is Aldous Huxley 's book Brave New World . In it , people were grown in artificial wombs , not born , and they could be genetically designed . In the book , a high level official of this society mentions to the main character that an experiment had been tried in which all the people made were brilliant , athletic and beautiful - anyway , characteristics that we admire in people ( nothing was said about picking their moral character ) . They ended up killing each other in competition for the better jobs and for leadership since nobody was willing to play the subservient menial role . Therefore , this society purposely grew humans who were at different levels ( some very mentally deficient ) to supply a distributions of people who could fit the distribution of roles necessary for society .

You face a much greater threat of potential harm from that than at the hands of a criminal . Are you as adamant about eating healthy as you are about the need to have a gun ? The fact is , we all constantly face the threat of potential harm every minute of every day . Risk is a part of living . I would like to know why guns specifically are needed to mitigate the risk of being the victim of a crime , when other methods ( better locks , alarms , non-lethal weapons like pepper spray and tasers ) can be effective .""","""I think a more telling question would be , why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe ?

So its a case of total gun freedom vs total `` gunlessness `` . I 'm not convinced that either of these `` what-if `` scenarios will occur . After all , as it is presently , gun crimes still occur , people have their rights to own guns revoked on a case by case basis , and dying of gun shots is actually very rare . I believe a balance can be found . And as for supporting the constitution , this issue is actually about supporting an ammendment to the constitution . If the constitution was so holy and inerrant , why did it need to be ammendments ? I 'm not the one that was so dissatisfied with the document that I had to ammend it anyway . And the insinuations and inuendos you say I made ( not actually saying what they were ) , the rest of your pro-gun team confirmed my observations , just as you did now . Thanks .""","""So you plan to move out of N.Y.in a year or two , and own a gun ? why not now ? N.Y.laws are sticker than most , but not all.You want to teach your kids to shoot ? Better do it now , later on it will probably be harder . Well if you do n't think that gun control is the most important issue in the world and you totally agree that people should be able to own guns , but yet you have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits , thats almost a contradiction of terms for someone that says their pro gun . I may be wrong but is anyone saying or implying total gun freedom ? What we are saying is , to many laws on it no more . 35-40 years ago we did n't have all this B.S.about it , you wanted a gun you went and got one ( in other words very readily available ) Walk down the street with one and you did n't have a S.W.A.T.team on you . We have seen to many gun rights taken so yeah every time a new policy or amendment comes along we are antsy about it . So if you support every amendment made to the constitution pertaining to guns , than I submit your not to interested in owning a gun . And for the record : gun toting bandits ( out here we say bandito 's ) are jumping out of every ally { figuratively speaking } .But the pro-gunners know that if the anti-gunners had their way , only the bandito 's have guns .""",DISAGREE,"""I also have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits""","""you have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits , thats almost a contradiction of terms for someone that says their pro gun"""

Can you prove that the big bang happened 15 billion years ago ? No , all the evidence that we have in favour is the red shift of starlight and the background microwave radiation ( which is all at the same temperature , give or take a few K ) . We all know how evolutionists interpret the evidence , but the evidence makes just as much more sense when interpreted through Dr Humphreys ' new young earth relativistic cosmology model . This is outlined in his book `` Starlight and Time `` and is an amazing read .

While we have not yet perfected a method of reliably predicting exactly what some perp will do if left in control with a gun in his hand in a crowded mall , we can assume that more harm will come if he is not taken down and disarmed . The fact that a citizen may legally have a gun in his pocket capable of knocking down a large animal rather than a pea-shooter that will only make it mad is comforting to me . I like big guns , too . I can agree somewhat with the idea of hesitating to interfere when an altercation seems imminent , but I can not agree that armed citizens should never `` endanger the lives of others `` by pulling his piece and firing at the perp .

5728,"""`` The Mexican Ambassador to the United States , Auturo Sarukhan , appeared on a CBS news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in Mexico . The ambassador says Americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the Mexican drug cartels because Â “ most of the guns confiscated by Mexican police can be traced back to the United States.Â ” That is not true , but the way that claim has been accepted by American politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda . ATFEÂ ’ s Fake Number We can almost forgive the Mexican ambassador for being confused when the United States agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws , the Federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , has made so many contradictory statements on the matter . ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90 % of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US . The problem is that 90 % number is n't true . Yet , that has n't kept it from being picked up and used by members of Congress , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and , of course , Mexican officials like Ambassador Sarukhan who are eager to blame the US for MexicoÂ ’ s problems . Real Weapons Source ? The 90 % number reported by Hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the U.S. for tracing , but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities . A spokesman for the ATFE , Matt Allen , has now `` clarified `` the number and admitted that only 17 % of the weapons found at crime scenes in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. Ironically , while Mexican officials have freely used the 90 % number from the ATFE , they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers . The truth is , they know better . We can easily understand Mexico 's reasons for preferring the 90 % number to the more accurate 17 % . Mexico does not want to openly discuss the many other sources of advanced weapons being used by the drug cartels . Thousands of advanced weapons and tons of military equipment are stolen from its own military and state police . Weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline , weapons that often originate in Venezuela , Colombia , and Nicaragua , or from purchases in Eastern Europe . But it is easier for a Mexican politician to blame the U.S. than to explain his own governmentÂ ’ s failure to police its borders , its ports of entry and its military installations . Did the Mexican ambassador mention that over 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels ? Lax Vehicle Inspection Certainly , no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico , but not the rocket-propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance . You ca n't buy that stuff at gun shops in Texas or Arizona . But for the sake of argument , what if it was true that 30 % of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the U.S. ? Could it be that Mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering Mexico from the U.S. ? Mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections . And could it be that Mexico 's decades-long opposition to a U.S. border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels ' gun-smuggling operations ? Why Strange Obama Response ? But what accounts for the Obama administration 's eagerness to let Mexico blame the U.S. for its spiraling violence ? Two explanations are possible : It may be that blaming American gun laws is for many Americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem . If we can end MexicoÂ ’ s chaos by making changes on this side of the border , that 's far easier than expecting Mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own -- like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage . The other explanation is more troublesome . Maybe the Obama administration has no clue how to help Mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself . It is obvious that ObamaÂ ’ s teams at the Justice Department and the State Department are exploiting the violence in Mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by Americans . The Obama crewÂ ’ s hostility to the Second Amendment has been clear for months . This may be yet another example of Rahm Emanuel 's maxim : `` Never let a good crisis go to waste. `` Mexico needs to face its own demons , beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry . The U.S. can help in many ways , such as enhancing our own border security . But adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law-abiding Americans will not help Mexico . If we are lucky , this theme of blaming American gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction .

5934,"""`` The Mexican Ambassador to the United States , Auturo Sarukhan , appeared on a CBS news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in Mexico . The ambassador says Americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the Mexican drug cartels because Â “ most of the guns confiscated by Mexican police can be traced back to the United States.Â ” That is not true , but the way that claim has been accepted by American politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda . ATFEÂ ’ s Fake Number We can almost forgive the Mexican ambassador for being confused when the United States agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws , the Federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , has made so many contradictory statements on the matter . ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90 % of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US . The problem is that 90 % number is n't true . Yet , that has n't kept it from being picked up and used by members of Congress , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and , of course , Mexican officials like Ambassador Sarukhan who are eager to blame the US for MexicoÂ ’ s problems . Real Weapons Source ? The 90 % number reported by Hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the U.S. for tracing , but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities . A spokesman for the ATFE , Matt Allen , has now `` clarified `` the number and admitted that only 17 % of the weapons found at crime scenes in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. Ironically , while Mexican officials have freely used the 90 % number from the ATFE , they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers . The truth is , they know better . We can easily understand Mexico 's reasons for preferring the 90 % number to the more accurate 17 % . Mexico does not want to openly discuss the many other sources of advanced weapons being used by the drug cartels . Thousands of advanced weapons and tons of military equipment are stolen from its own military and state police . Weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline , weapons that often originate in Venezuela , Colombia , and Nicaragua , or from purchases in Eastern Europe . But it is easier for a Mexican politician to blame the U.S. than to explain his own governmentÂ ’ s failure to police its borders , its ports of entry and its military installations . Did the Mexican ambassador mention that over 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels ? Lax Vehicle Inspection Certainly , no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico , but not the rocket-propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance . You ca n't buy that stuff at gun shops in Texas or Arizona . But for the sake of argument , what if it was true that 30 % of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the U.S. ? Could it be that Mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering Mexico from the U.S. ? Mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections . And could it be that Mexico 's decades-long opposition to a U.S. border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels ' gun-smuggling operations ? Why Strange Obama Response ? But what accounts for the Obama administration 's eagerness to let Mexico blame the U.S. for its spiraling violence ? Two explanations are possible : It may be that blaming American gun laws is for many Americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem . If we can end MexicoÂ ’ s chaos by making changes on this side of the border , that 's far easier than expecting Mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own -- like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage . The other explanation is more troublesome . Maybe the Obama administration has no clue how to help Mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself . It is obvious that ObamaÂ ’ s teams at the Justice Department and the State Department are exploiting the violence in Mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by Americans . The Obama crewÂ ’ s hostility to the Second Amendment has been clear for months . This may be yet another example of Rahm Emanuel 's maxim : `` Never let a good crisis go to waste. `` Mexico needs to face its own demons , beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry . The U.S. can help in many ways , such as enhancing our own border security . But adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law-abiding Americans will not help Mexico . If we are lucky , this theme of blaming American gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction . If it is more than that , if the Obama administration really believes this is the answer to Mexico 's problems , then we are lost in a swamp. ``""","""`` As President CalderÃ³n and I discussed , I am urging the Senate in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war , `` President Obama proclaimed in Mexico City last month . He also incorrectly repeated the errant statistic that 90 percent of guns in the hands of Mexican drug cartels come from America . ( In actuality , according to ATF special agent William Newell , about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States . And this figure has not been broken down to see how many came from civilian gun shops and how many were purchased from the U.S. military by Mexico 's government . ) '' We 're going to be very focused on this . It 's going to be a top priority. `` ABC News quoted an administration official who said that Obama `` felt that it was important to push now for the ratification of this treaty because the question of illegal small-arms is of great concern to the countries throughout the hemisphere a [ s ] it affects their safety.Â ” You have the ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover spouting the 90 % figure , Then everyone up and on down jumping on board with it . Then ATF special agent William Newell corrects the figure and goes on to state they do n't know how many came from the private sector and how many came from the US Gov giving them to Mexico . Yet we are supposed to punish the law abiding because other countries either ca n't or wo n't get control of their criminals .""",DISAGREE,"""90 % of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US""","""17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States to punish the law abiding because other countries either ca n't or wo n't get control of their criminals ."""

Weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from Guatemala and by boats landing on its 8,000 miles of coastline , weapons that often originate in Venezuela , Colombia , and Nicaragua , or from purchases in Eastern Europe . But it is easier for a Mexican politician to blame the U.S. than to explain his own governmentÂ ’ s failure to police its borders , its ports of entry and its military installations . Did the Mexican ambassador mention that over 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels ? Lax Vehicle Inspection Certainly , no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico , but not the rocket-propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance . You ca n't buy that stuff at gun shops in Texas or Arizona . But for the sake of argument , what if it was true that 30 % of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the U.S. ? Could it be that Mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering Mexico from the U.S. ? Mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections . And could it be that Mexico 's decades-long opposition to a U.S. border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels ' gun-smuggling operations ? Why Strange Obama Response ? But what accounts for the Obama administration 's eagerness to let Mexico blame the U.S. for its spiraling violence ? Two explanations are possible : It may be that blaming American gun laws is for many Americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem . If we can end MexicoÂ ’ s chaos by making changes on this side of the border , that 's far easier than expecting Mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own -- like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage . The other explanation is more troublesome . Maybe the Obama administration has no clue how to help Mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself . It is obvious that ObamaÂ ’ s teams at the Justice Department and the State Department are exploiting the violence in Mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by Americans . The Obama crewÂ ’ s hostility to the Second Amendment has been clear for months . This may be yet another example of Rahm Emanuel 's maxim : `` Never let a good crisis go to waste. `` Mexico needs to face its own demons , beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry . The U.S. can help in many ways , such as enhancing our own border security . But adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law-abiding Americans will not help Mexico . If we are lucky , this theme of blaming American gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction . If it is more than that , if the Obama administration really believes this is the answer to Mexico 's problems , then we are lost in a swamp. ``""","""`` As President CalderÃ³n and I discussed , I am urging the Senate in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war , `` President Obama proclaimed in Mexico City last month . He also incorrectly repeated the errant statistic that 90 percent of guns in the hands of Mexican drug cartels come from America . ( In actuality , according to ATF special agent William Newell , about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States . And this figure has not been broken down to see how many came from civilian gun shops and how many were purchased from the U.S. military by Mexico 's government . ) '' We 're going to be very focused on this . It 's going to be a top priority. `` ABC News quoted an administration official who said that Obama `` felt that it was important to push now for the ratification of this treaty because the question of illegal small-arms is of great concern to the countries throughout the hemisphere a [ s ] it affects their safety.Â ” You have the ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover spouting the 90 % figure , Then everyone up and on down jumping on board with it . Then ATF special agent William Newell corrects the figure and goes on to state they do n't know how many came from the private sector and how many came from the US Gov giving them to Mexico . Yet we are supposed to punish the law abiding because other countries either ca n't or wo n't get control of their criminals .""",DISAGREE,"""ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover told Congress last year that 90 % of the weapons seized in Mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the US .

6151,"""2 ) Just because something has changed from one age to the next , this does not necessarily mean that one begat the other .""","""Well , that was badly stated . But we 've been over this before and you still do n't seem to grasp . No one claims that any particular living animal is descended from any particular fossil . However , given the nature of life that we do observe , where we can see many species of equus , 36 species of cat , 28 species of canid , 8 or 10 species of bear ( with as many more extinct species ) , 850,000 species of beetle , and on and on , we conclude that life was similar in the past . And while we can look at a fossil species of theropod dinosaur and find many avian characteristics , we do not conclude that this fossil was ancestral to birds . But we know that there were probably many species of theropods that had avian characteristics , just like there are many animals with cat-like features . Recent discoveries are bearing out that conclusion . So we do n't say that this fossil is ancestral to that fossil or to this living organism . But we do say that this fossil shows characteristics that we would expect in an ancestral form . Thus , Archaeopteryx is not claimed to be ancestral to birds - in fact , is is believed to have eventually gone extinct ( in all three known species ) .

There 's the hemlocked Socrates , the house-arrested Galileo , the exiled Rousseau . And to this list of giants it seems that we are now expected to add the name of Michael Bellesiles . Mr. Bellesiles is the former Emory professor who shook the scholarly world in 2000 with his book `` Arming America. `` An academic bombshell , the tome went against long-held beliefs by claiming that few colonial Americans actually owned guns . This set off a riotous public debate over whether the Second Amendment was designed to protect individual gun rights . Mr. Bellesiles was showered with prizes and media praise , becoming an instant academic star . That is , until his peers started looking into that little thing called research . Reputable scholars in the ensuing months tore apart his work on probate and military records , travel narratives , and other documents . Mr. Bellesiles , when asked to explain , provided ever-more outlandish excuses : that his notes had been lost in a flood , that his Web site had been hacked , that he could n't remember where he 'd found certain documents . The officials of the prestigious Bancroft Prize stripped him of his award , he left Emory and Knopf chose to stop publishing his book . Most of us sighed happily and figured that was the end of that academic scandal . But oh , no . It turns out that Mr. Bellesiles is still riding his dead horse , his nonexistent guns still blazing . Soft Skull Press ( which takes pride in putting out books that other publishers avoid like ricin ) has not only agreed to reissue `` Arming America `` but has decided to release Mr. Bellesiles 's latest response to his critics . This 59-page pamphlet , `` Weighed in an Even Balance , `` is a spirited attempt by Mr. Bellesiles to turn himself into the world 's latest misunderstood genius . As such , it 's worth reading for pure entertainment value . Much of the booklet is a repeat of the professor 's creative excuses and dissembling . He explains again about the flood and helpfully assures us that he is not an agent of the Zionist Occupational Government ( though surely that is why the Bancroft panel took away his prize , right ? ) . He does acknowledge a few errors , but only after pointing out that `` even the finest scholars . . . make mistakes. `` As proof , he cites one blooper in esteemed historian David McCullough 's 1,120-page biography of Harry Truman . But the most amusing parts of the pamphlet are those meant to support our scholar 's belief that he is up against a stubborn world that refuses to open its mind to the truth . And his sense of persecution and righteousness is very much on display . The very title of his book is taken from Job : `` Let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may known mine integrity. `` And that 's just for starters . The pamphlet is sprinkled with quotations from thoughtful men , all meant to back up Mr. Bellesiles 's argument that he is fighting the good fight . We hear from Isaiah Berlin : `` Few things have done more harm than the belief on the part of individuals or groups . . . that he or she or they are in sole possession of the truth. `` One epigraph recounts that in the 16th century , Oxford used to fine any student who diverged from the teachings of Aristotle . We are clearly meant to envision a feisty Mr. Bellesiles handing over his shillings to the dons . We are treated to lecturing tracts about the benefits of scholarly disagreement , the complex nature of historical research and the need for academic exploration . And finally , in case readers still are n't getting his drift , Mr. Bellesiles sums it all up in his conclusion : `` There are those who rest their very identity on the notion of a certain , unchanging past . The vision that society is unalterable is not just incorrect , it is dangerously undemocratic , and as such should be of concern to every modern historian. `` In fact , the academic world is hardly a monolothic creature that resists all change . If it were , we 'd still be trying to explain how the sun moves around the Earth . Most historians and scientists are wise enough to realize that new discoveries or interpretations hold out opportunity . But before they completely cast aside mountains of research , they usually demand some proof . Mr. Bellesiles 's problem is n't that he 's misunderstood ; it 's that he still has n't given them any .

This set off a riotous public debate over whether the Second Amendment was designed to protect individual gun rights . Mr. Bellesiles was showered with prizes and media praise , becoming an instant academic star . That is , until his peers started looking into that little thing called research . Reputable scholars in the ensuing months tore apart his work on probate and military records , travel narratives , and other documents . Mr. Bellesiles , when asked to explain , provided ever-more outlandish excuses : that his notes had been lost in a flood , that his Web site had been hacked , that he could n't remember where he 'd found certain documents . The officials of the prestigious Bancroft Prize stripped him of his award , he left Emory and Knopf chose to stop publishing his book . Most of us sighed happily and figured that was the end of that academic scandal . But oh , no . It turns out that Mr. Bellesiles is still riding his dead horse , his nonexistent guns still blazing . Soft Skull Press ( which takes pride in putting out books that other publishers avoid like ricin ) has not only agreed to reissue `` Arming America `` but has decided to release Mr. Bellesiles 's latest response to his critics . This 59-page pamphlet , `` Weighed in an Even Balance , `` is a spirited attempt by Mr. Bellesiles to turn himself into the world 's latest misunderstood genius . As such , it 's worth reading for pure entertainment value . Much of the booklet is a repeat of the professor 's creative excuses and dissembling . He explains again about the flood and helpfully assures us that he is not an agent of the Zionist Occupational Government ( though surely that is why the Bancroft panel took away his prize , right ? ) . He does acknowledge a few errors , but only after pointing out that `` even the finest scholars . . . make mistakes. `` As proof , he cites one blooper in esteemed historian David McCullough 's 1,120-page biography of Harry Truman . But the most amusing parts of the pamphlet are those meant to support our scholar 's belief that he is up against a stubborn world that refuses to open its mind to the truth . And his sense of persecution and righteousness is very much on display . The very title of his book is taken from Job : `` Let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may known mine integrity. `` And that 's just for starters . The pamphlet is sprinkled with quotations from thoughtful men , all meant to back up Mr. Bellesiles 's argument that he is fighting the good fight . We hear from Isaiah Berlin : `` Few things have done more harm than the belief on the part of individuals or groups . . . that he or she or they are in sole possession of the truth. `` One epigraph recounts that in the 16th century , Oxford used to fine any student who diverged from the teachings of Aristotle . We are clearly meant to envision a feisty Mr. Bellesiles handing over his shillings to the dons . We are treated to lecturing tracts about the benefits of scholarly disagreement , the complex nature of historical research and the need for academic exploration . And finally , in case readers still are n't getting his drift , Mr. Bellesiles sums it all up in his conclusion : `` There are those who rest their very identity on the notion of a certain , unchanging past . The vision that society is unalterable is not just incorrect , it is dangerously undemocratic , and as such should be of concern to every modern historian. `` In fact , the academic world is hardly a monolothic creature that resists all change . If it were , we 'd still be trying to explain how the sun moves around the Earth . Most historians and scientists are wise enough to realize that new discoveries or interpretations hold out opportunity . But before they completely cast aside mountains of research , they usually demand some proof . Mr. Bellesiles 's problem is n't that he 's misunderstood ; it 's that he still has n't given them any . Or as the old saying goes : `` To be a persecuted genius , you not only have to be persecuted ; you also have to be right. `` Ms. Strassel is a senior editorial page writer for The Wall Street Journal .""",DISAGREE,"""So then you believe the 2nd amendment guarantees an individual right""","""To be a persecuted genius , you not only have to be persecuted ; you also have to be right. `` Ms. Strassel is a senior editorial page writer for The Wall Street Journal ."""

Maybe I 'm wrong but , is n't lowering shootings a siginificant point in those who want to ban guns ? So they want to make the guns illegal and thus the only place they would be available is in the `` black market `` . Now we all know that guns in cases serve as a form of self protection from other people who would want to commit harm to the indiviusal . It is simply an average law abiding man who wants to have this pistol or handgun to protect him and or his family from those who would want to bring harm upon him family . The illegalization of these handguns would make it virtually impossible for those law abiding to get one of these guns in hopes of protecting his loved ones . I suppose a hope for those for the illegalization is that this would keep guns out of the hands of criminals . But that does n't make much sense . Making it against the law to own a gun is not going to stop the selling , posession and illegal use of them . Instead it only takes protection out of the hands of those who who only want to use it for `` good `` and does not do alot for those who would use it for `` evil `` . Like weed , making guns illegal would not lower the crime rate , but instead may very well increase those innocent dead because they were without protection .""","""Your argument is akin to saying `` We ca n't stop people over-dosing on heroin , so let 's legalise it `` Why have limitations on hand-grenades or mines ?

Therefore it is false to believe that `` if you could trace the evolution of [ any ] system back in time with perfect accuracy , [ then what it is now ] would all be originally determined by the system 's initial state . '' .""","""But of course ! Of course you have to take into account all the input that any one system receives from all external sources in order to trace back to an initial state . ( No system can ever be truly closed , truly isolated from the rest of the universe , for what should be obvious reasons . Certain systems are only classified as 'closed ' for experiments ' sake because they have been very efficiently isolated and the parameters of unavoidable input are precisely calculable and can be subtracted from results , thereby giving the results that a truly closed system would provide . ) In your pool-shot example below , for instance , the initial state must take account of the wear & amp ; tear of the table , the strength of the cue , the slope of the floor , humidity , temperature and every other variable . So any such 'backtracking ' ( which is highly hypothetical given the extreme complexity of the calculations ) has to take into account the knowledge that no system is isolated . This is part of what chaos theory attempts to do , and why chaos theory must deal in probabilities until we have computers ordres of magnitude more powerful than we do today .""",AGREE,"""Not so .
